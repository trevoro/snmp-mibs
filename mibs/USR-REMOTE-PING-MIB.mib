-- The remote ping MIB is a diagnostic tool intended to test reachability,
-- reliability, and round trip delay between a managed USR NAS and any IP
-- system (PC, UNIX, another NAS, etc.) implementing the common ICMP Echo
-- protocol, also known as 'ping' (from the Unix command 'ping' based
-- on that same protocol).
--
-- As a side effect the tool can also be used to estimate DNS processing
-- delays by monitoring the object usrRemotePingDNSResolutionDelay.
--
--
-- In order to test reachability to a given device, an SNMP client
-- application should:
--
-- 1. Issue an SNMP GET for the object usrRemotePingIndexNext.0.
--    (assume the reply is 'x'). This step is optional, clients might browse
--    the table or just attempt a creation on any index until it succeeds.
--
-- 2. Create a new entry in the Remote Ping table by performing a command
--    such as 'SNMP SET usrRemotePingRowStatus.x = createAndWait.
--
-- 3. If the above succeeds, set values of the various settable objects in
--    the new row.
--    In particular, make sure to set usrRemotePingDestination.x to the name
--    or address to be 'pinged'.
--
--    Alternatively, it is possible to combine several settings on a single
--    SNMP PDU. The PDU could also include a rowStatus value of createAndGo
--    (it should be the last entry in the PDU in relation with a given row)
--    in which case a new row will be created, modified and activated in one
--    transaction.
--
-- 4. After setting the various objects of row x to desired values,
--    modify usrRemotePingRowStatus.x to 'active'.
--
-- 5. If the above succeeds, clients will now typically monitor the value of
--                'usrRemotePingConnectionStatus.x'
--    in order to find out if the process is making progress as expected
--    (it should return 'pinging' or 'completed' very soon now).
--
-- 6. Once 'usrRemotePingConnectionStatus' returns the value 'pinging',
--    clients will typically monitor progress by displaying the ongoing
--    values of:
--         usrRemotePingRequestsSent
--         usrRemotePingRepliesReceived
--         usrRemotePingTimeouts
--         usrRemotePingMinRoundTripTime
--         usrRemotePingMaxRoundTripTime
--         usrRemotePingAverageRoundTripTime
--
--    Other objects could be monitored for various diagnostics purposes,
--    such as:
--         usrRemotePingResolvedIPAddress
--         usrRemotePingCreationTime
--         usrRemotePingActivationTime
--         usrRemotePingLastChanged
--
-- 7. A particular ping sequence is completed when
--    'usrRemotePingConnectionStatus' returns 'completed'. At this point,
--    all the values row x will be steady. Note that, unless
--    'usrRemotePingSelfDestroyDelay' is zero, the row will be
--    self-destroyed a number of minutes after completion (see
--    'usrRemotePingSelfDestroyDelay' which has a default value of 10 minutes).
--
-- 8. In order to start a new sequence using the configuration values
--    already available in an existing row, set 'usrRemotePingRowStatus'
--    first to 'notInService' and then again to 'active'."

--      usr_traceroute.mib - An enterprise specific Traceroute MIB
--
-- Author:         Jeff Haag
-- Created:        Mar-13-1997
--
--
-- The traceroute MIB is a diagnostic tool intended to retrieve route 
-- information between a managed CommWork's NAS and any IP system (PC, Unix, 
-- another NAS etc).  It only requires the routers along the way to the
-- the destination to implement IP routing and ICMP Time Exceeded messages.
-- The destination must implement UDP and return ICMP error message 
-- destination unreachable.
-- The functionality is similar to the Unix command 'traceroute' based
-- on those same protocols.
--
-- In order to determine the route to a host, the SNMP client application 
-- should do the following:
--
--
-- *********To start the traceroute*********
--
--  1. Create a new entry in the Traceroute table by performing a command
--     such as 'SNMP SET usrTracerouteRowStatus.x = createAndWait.
--
--  2. If the above succeeds, set values of the various settable objects in
--     the new row.  In particular, make sure to set 
--     usrTracerouteDestination.x to the name or address whose route is to 
--     be traced.
--
--  3. After setting the various objects of row x to desired values,
--     modify usrTracerouteRowStatus.x to 'active'.
--
-- OR
--
--  1. set values of the various settable objects in a new row.  
--     In particular, make sure to set usrTracerouteDestination.x to the 
--     name or address whose route is to be traced. 
--
--  2. Create and activate new entry in the Traceroute table by performing a command
--     such as 'SNMP SET usrTracerouteRowStatus.x = createAndGo.
--
--  3. The row status will automatically get set to active after row creation
--     and the command will begin
--
-- *********After starting the traceroute*********
--
-- 4. If the above succeeds, clients will now typically monitor the values of
--    'usrTracerouteState.x' in order to find out if the process is 
--    'completed' or an error has occurred
--
-- 5. Once 'usrTracerouteState.x' returns the value 'completed',
--    clients can view the route information in the usrTracerouteHopTable
--    by looking at rows that have a matching usrTraceRouteIndex
--
-- 6. A particular traceroute is completed when
--    'usrTracerouteState.x' returns 'completed'. At this point,
--    all the values of row x will be steady and no more entries for this 
--    traceroute will be added to the hop table. 
--
-- 7. In order to start a new sequence using the configuration values
--    already available in an existing row, set 'usrTracerouteRowStatus'
--    first to 'notInService' and then again to 'active'."  This will 
--	  automatically clean up any previous corresponding entries in the 
--    traceroute hop table
--
-- ******************
-- additional notes
-- ******************
-- a)  A row will be removed from the table after 60 minutes if there has been
--     no activity
-- b)  A row may be deleted/destroyed at any time, even if the row status is 
--     'active'
