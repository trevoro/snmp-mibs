               "This table is a list of LAN-Trans realm parameters. 
               This table has one row entry for each allocated LAN-Trans  
               IP address. Each row must have at least a valid  
               cabhCdpLanAddrMethod, a cabhCdpLanAddrIpType, a unique  
               cabhCdpLanAddrIp, and a unique cabhCdpLanAddrClientId 
               value. 
                            
               Static/Manual address assignment: To create a new DHCP  
               address reservation, the NMS creates a row with: an index 
               comprised of a new cabhCdpLanAddrIp and its  
               cabhCdpLanAddrIpType, a new unique cabhCdpLanAddrClientID 
               (an empty LeaseCreateTime and empty LeaseExpireTime,) 
               and a cabhCdpLanDataAddrRowStatus of createAndGo(4).  
               If the syntax and values of the new row - indicating a  
               reservation - are valid, the PS must set   
               cabhCdpLanAddrMethod to reservationInactive(1) and 
               cabhCdpLanDataAddrRowStatus to active(1). When the PS 
               grants a lease for a reserved IP, it must set the  
               cabhCdpLanAddrMethod object for that row to  
               reservationActive(2). When a lease for a reserved IP  
               expires, the PS must set the corresponding rowÆs 
               cabhCdpLanAddrMethod object to reservationInactive(1). 
               For row entries that represent lease reservations - rows 
               in which the cabhCdpLanAddrMethod object has a value of 
               either reservationInactive(1) or reservationActive(2) - 
               the cabhCdpLanAddrIpType, cabhCdpLanAddrIp,  
               cabhCdpLanAddrClientID, cabhCdpLanAddrMethod, and  
               cabhCdpLanAddrHostName object values must persist across 
               PS reboots. 
                 
               Dynamic address assignment: When the PS grants a lease 
               for a non-reserved IP, it must set the 
               cabhCdpLanAddrMethod object for that row to 
               dynamicActive(4). When a lease for a non-reserved IP 
               expires, the PS must set the corresponding rowÆs 
               cabhCdpLanAddrMethod object to dynamicInactive(3). 
               The PS must create new row entries using 
               cabhCdpLanAddrIp values that are unique to this table. 
                
               If all cabhCdpLanAddrIp values in the range defined by  
               cabhCdpLanPoolStart and cabhCdpLanPoolEnd are in use in 
               this table, the PS may overwrite the 
               cabhCdpLanAddrClientId of a row that has a 
               cabhCdpLanAddrMethod object with a value of  
               dynamicInactive(3) with a new cabhCdpLanAddrClientId 
               value and use that cabhCdpLanAddrIp as part of a new 
               lease. For row entries that represent active leases - 
               rows in which the cabhCdpLanAddrMethod object has a value 
               of dynamicActive(4) - the cabhCdpLanAddrIpType,
