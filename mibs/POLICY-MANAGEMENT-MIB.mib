        infrastructures."

    REVISION "200010111500Z"    -- October 11, 2000
    DESCRIPTION
        "The original version of this MIB, published as RFCXXXX."
    ::= { experimental 107 }

UTF8String ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT "255a"
    STATUS       current
    DESCRIPTION
        "An octet string containing information typically in
        human-readable form.

        To facilitate internationalization, this
        information is represented using the ISO/IEC
        IS 10646-1 character set, encoded as an octet
        string using the UTF-8 transformation format
        described in [RFC2279].

        Since additional code points are added by
        amendments to the 10646 standard from time
        to time, implementations must be prepared to
        encounter any code point from 0x00000000 to
        0x7fffffff.  Byte sequences that do not
        correspond to the valid UTF-8 encoding of a
        code point or are outside this range are
        prohibited.

        The use of control codes should be avoided.

        When it is necessary to represent a newline,
        the control code sequence CR LF should be used.

        For code points not directly supported by user
        interface hardware or software, an alternative
        means of entry and display, such as hexadecimal,
        may be provided.

        For information encoded in 7-bit US-ASCII,
        the UTF-8 encoding is identical to the
        US-ASCII encoding.

        UTF-8 may require multiple bytes to represent a
        single character / code point; thus the length
        of this object in octets may be different from
        the number of characters encoded.  Similarly,
        size constraints refer to the number of encoded
        octets, not the number of characters represented
        by an encoding.

        Note that when this TC is used for an object that
        is used or envisioned to be used as an index, then
        a SIZE restriction MUST be specified so that the
        number of sub-identifiers for any object instance
        does not exceed the limit of 128, as defined by
        [RFC1905].

        Note that the size of an UTF8String object is
        measured in octets, not characters."

        "The order in which policies on the local system are
        evaluated. A policy with a higher precedence value will
        be evaluated after a policy with a lower precedence. For
        example, a policy with a precedence value of 999 will be
        evaluated after a policy with a precedence value of 998.
        These values must be unique on the local policy system
        that realizes this module. The value for a particular
        policy should be the same across an administrative
        domain, though that is not mandatory.

        When the local policy system performs the evaluation in the
        pmPolicyFilter for the policy identified by this row it will
        also read the pmTrackingElementToPolicyStatus object for each
        object returned as a result of the policy evaluation.  If that
        object is set to modified(3), then the pmPolicyAction shall
        not be taken on that element.

        The value of precedence(4), of pmTrackingElementToPolicyStatus
        is an indication that when an evaluation was performed by
        another policy, the pmTrackingElementToPolicyStatus was found
        to have a value of on(1) and that policy had a higher
        precedence value than the policy that initially set the value
        of the pmTrackingElementToPolicyStatus to on(1). In this
        event, the pmTrackingElementToPolicyPrecedence object shall
        have the value of the pmPolicyIndex for the policy with the
        higher precedence value entered. If the policy identified by
        this row of the pmPolicyTable has a higher precedence value
        than the value found in pmTrackingElementToPolicyPrecedence
        then the pmPolicyAction should be performed on the element and
        the pmTrackingElementToPolicyPrecedence object updated with
        the value of the pmPolicyIndex for this policy. The only
        exception to these rules is when the policy that has the
        higher precedence value in not currently running, i.e., the
        schedule is off."

-- Element Type Registration Table

-- The Element Type Registration table is used for the manager to
-- learn what element types are being managed by the system and to
-- register new types if necessary. An element type is registered by
-- providing the OID of an SNMP object (i.e., without the
-- instance). Each SNMP instance that exists under that object is a
-- distinct element. The address of the element is the index part of
-- the discovered OID. This address will be supplied to policy filters
-- and actions so that these expressions can inspect and configure the
-- element.
--
-- Before registering an element type, it is the responsibility of a
-- manager to inspect the table and see if it is already registered
-- (by the agent or another manager). Note that entries that differ
-- only in the last OID (which specifies which object in an entry) are
-- effectively duplicates and should be treated as such by the
-- manager.
