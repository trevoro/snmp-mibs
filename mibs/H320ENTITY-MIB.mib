--
-- This defines the MIB in support of the ITU-T H.320 protocols.
-- This MIB is a collection of common objects which can be used in a H.320 terminal,
-- a H.320 MCU and a H.320/H.323 gateway.  Objects are grouped as tables.
-- a H.320 terminal will have only one row of the table.  A H.320 MCU and a 
-- a H.320/H.323 gateway may have multiple entries in the table.

                  "A list of capability entries.  Objects are grouped as a 
                  table so that one can use this table in the H.320 terminal, 
                  the H.320 MCU, and the H.320/H.323 gateway.  
                  The total number of capability entries is
                  equal to the number of H.320 entities in a system.
                  For instance, there will be one row of capability
                  in the table of the H.320 terminal.  The number of rows 
                  will be equal to the number of H320 entities in the MCU
                  and the H320/H323 gateway. 
                  These entries describe the general capability of a system.  
                  Within a particular call, the behavior of the system is
                  further constrained by the characteristics of the call itself. 
                  For example, h320CapsEntityMaxVideoRate describes 
                  the maximum video rate a system can handle (perhaps 
                  due to processing constraints).  A particular call's transfer 
                  rate may limit video to a lower rate "
