    DESCRIPTION
           "This MIB module defines management information specific to
           the use of certificates in conjunction with Fibre Channel's
           FC-SP specification.

           Since FC-SP leverages a subset of IPsec and IKEv2 (see RFC
           4595), a subset of the management information defined for
           the use of certificates with IPsec/IKEv2 is also applicable
           to FC-SP.  Thus, this MIB module leverages RFC wwww and
           RFC xxxx for the management of certificates, CAs and CRLs.
-- RFC Editor: replace wwww with actual RFC number for
-- [IPSP-IPSEC-ACTION], and replace xxxx with actual RFC number for
-- [IPSP-IKE-ACTION] & remove this note

           Specifically, the information defined in this MIB module
           consists of a pointer into the IPsec/IKEv2 MIB modules,
           plus minimal additional item(s) of information which are
           considered to be important in a Fibre Channel environment.

           Copyright (C) The IETF Trust (2007).  This version
           of this MIB module is part of RFC yyyy;  see the RFC
           itself for full legal notices."
