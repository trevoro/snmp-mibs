-- Shelf Card/n BusTap/b
-- A BusTap component represents a physical bus tap on a card. A bus 
-- tap is a card's interface to a bus; it provides a pathway for the card 
-- to send cells over the bus to the other cards in the module, and to 
-- receive cells sent to it over the bus by the other cards in the module.
-- A card's BusTap components are created automatically whenver the 
-- card begins acting as an active or standby LP, and remain in 
-- existence as long as the card remains operational; BusTap 
-- components cannot be added or deleted.

      When no values are in the set, this indicates that either the attribute 
      is not supported or that none of the status conditions described 
      below are present.
      
      The value inTest indicates that the resource is undergoing a test 
      procedure. If adminState is locked or shuttingDown, the normal 
      users are precluded from using the resource and controlStatus is 
      reservedForTest. Tests that do not exclude additional users can be 
      present in any operational or administrative state but the

      The value failed indicates that the component has an internal fault 
      that prevents it from operating. The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value dependency indicates that the component cannot operate 
      because some other resource on which it depends is unavailable. 
      The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value powerOff indicates the resource requires power to be 
      applied and it is not powered on. The operationalState is disabled.

      operation (either manual, automatic, or both) to be performed to 
      place it on-line and make it available for use. The operationalState 
      is disabled.
      
      The value offDuty indicates the resource is inactive in accordance 
      with a predetermined time schedule. In the absence of other 
      disabling conditions, the operationalState is enabled or disabled.
      
      The value degraded indicates the service provided by the

      capacity. However, the resource remains available for service. The

      it can perform its normal functions, and this procedure has not been 
      initiated. The operationalState is disabled.

      is determined automatically by the bus tap by monitoring signals 
      generated by each bus tap on the bus; it cannot be changed by the 
      operator. Normally, every card in the module signals its availability 
      on both buses; if a card does not signal its availability on a bus this 
      indicates that the card is not present or that its bus tap has failed. By 
      examining this attribute for both of a card's BusTap components, it 
      is possible to determine which cards are present in the module and 
      which buses each can use.
      Note: If failuresInEffect contains either selfTest or clockSignal the 
      bus tap is unable to monitor the availability of the bus taps on the 
      bus; cardsAvailable will indicate that no bus taps are available on

-- Shelf Bus/b Test
-- The Test component is used to verify the operation of a bus. A bus 
-- test may be run as part of a regular maintenance program, or to 
-- diagnose the cause of a bus-related problem. The Test component is 
-- created automatically, and cannot be added or deleted.
-- 
-- The bus test ensures that the bus taps on a specific bus are 
-- functioning properly at minimal utilization rates. The bus to be 
-- tested must be locked while testing is in progress. The test only 
-- involves bus taps on operational cards (active and standby LPs). If 
-- an operational card becomes non-operational or fails to respond 
-- during the test, it is dropped from the test and is not allowed to 
-- rejoin; however, the results of any tests on its bus tap up to that 
-- point are preserved. The results of the test can help to determine 
-- which portions of the bus system are faulty, if any.
-- 
-- A bus test is composed of several different tests. The tests are 
-- performed in the following order.
-- 1) Bus tap self-test: Each bus tap executes its self-test.
-- 2) Clock source test: Each bus tap ensures that it can receive clock 
-- signals from the active control processor clock source and the 
-- alternate clock source (if present).
-- 3) Broadcast test: Each bus tap ensures that it can receive a 
-- broadcast frame over the backplane from every operational card 
-- (including itself).
-- 4) Ping test: Each bus tap ensures that it can receive a low priority 
-- non-broadcast frame over the backplane from every operational 
-- card (including itself).
-- Once all of the tests have been performed, the ping test is repeated 
-- continuously until the bus test is terminated; this repetition helps to 
-- detect transient bus faults. The bus test stops automatically after a 
-- specified time interval, or if it detects a bus tap self-test failure, an 
-- active control processor clock source test failure, or a broadcast test 
-- failure.
