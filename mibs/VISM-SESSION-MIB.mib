-- The relationship between session set, session group and RUDP session 
-- is that: For fault tolerant case each session set contains two groups.
-- Each group connects to one MGC, One active, one standby. 
-- If one MGC fails, the other MGC will inform the session mamager to 
-- switch over.  
-- If the set configuration is non-fault tolerant, each set contains one group.
--
-- Each session group contains upto four RUDP sessions. 
--
-- Session set is explicitly created first, then session group can be  
-- created in this set.
-- After session group is created, session can be created in the group.
-- 
-- For deletion, session has to be deleted first. However, the last session 
-- can not be deleted if there is still LAPD entry. 
-- A group can only be deleted if there is no more session in it. 
-- Session set will be deleted when the last group in the set has been 
-- deleted.
