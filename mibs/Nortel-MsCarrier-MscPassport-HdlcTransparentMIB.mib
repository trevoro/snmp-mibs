      otherwise the component inherits the CID of its parent. The top-
      level component has a CID of 0.
      
      Every operator session also has a CID, which is the CID 
      provisioned for the operator's user ID. An operator will see only the 
      stream data for components having a matching CID. Also, the 
      operator will be allowed to issue commands for only those 
      components which have a matching CID.
      
      An operator CID of 0 is used to identify the Network Manager 
      (referred to as 'NetMan' in DPN). This CID matches the CID of 
      any component. Values 1 to 8191 inclusive (equivalent to 'basic 
      CIDs' in DPN) may be assigned to specific customers."

-- The Framer component controls link layer framing for application 
-- components sending and receiving data on a link interface. It is also 
-- through Framer, that an application component is associated with a 
-- specific hardware link interface.
-- 
-- The Framer component provides provisionable attributes related to 
-- datapath aspects of the hardware interface (such as crc and frame 
-- length) rather than interface specific attributes (such as modem 
-- leads and clocking) which are associated with specific hardware 
-- components (such as V35/n or DS1/n). The Framer component also 
-- provides a provisionable attribute which binds the application 
-- component to a specific hardware component.
-- 
-- The Framer component contains operational attributes for link 
-- interface datapath statistics (such as frame counts and aborts).

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute is the PLC's remote end point's address in the format 
      of a Passport component name. The syntax of a component is:
      'em/node type/instance'. For an alternative representation of end 
      point's addresses, see addressToCall and localAddress PLC 
      attributes. When using Passport component name representation, 
      end points are identified using a node name and a service name. As 
      an example, the end point component for a third Htds service on 
      node MoonBase is: 'EM/MoonBase HTDS/3'. If the remoteName is 
      provisioned, it must match the name of the remote end or the 
      connection will not be established even if the remote end is 
      provisioned correctly. If no remoteName is provisioned, then this 
      LC will accept connections from any other remote LC and it will 
      not originate calls. Connections establish faster and are unique if 
      both ends are provisioned with remoteName. 
      RemoteName should be used when the remote end of the connection 
      resides within the same topology region. If it resides in a different 
      topology region, then addressToCall and localAddress PLC 
      attributes should be used. When both remoteName and 
      addressToCall are provisioned, addressToCall takes precedence. 
      That is, connection will be established to the service specified by 
      addressToCall.
      These strings are case insensitive, but the complete component 
      name must be input."

      where the operator must specify, through provisioning, a static route 
      termed the manualPath. A manual pathType connection is nearly 
      identical to a normal path type connection with the exception that 
      the route is pre-provisioned. For a manual pathType, bandwidth 
      reservations are respected along the path exactly as in a normal

      regardless of the bandwidth available the route is granted provided 
      the trunks are operational and there are sufficient Logical Channels 
      (LChs). 
      The forced pathType could result in over committing the reserved 
      bandwidth allowed on a trunk. A better way to achieve the effects of 
      a forced pathType is to use a manual pathType with setupPriority = 
      0 and holdingPriority = 0. In this manner the path will reserve

      A manual pathType connection is nearly identical to a normal path 
      type connection with the exception that the route is pre-provisioned. 
      For a manual pathType, bandwidth reservations are respected along 
      the path exactly as in a normal path. The last type, the forced 
      pathType, is also a manual path but regardless of the bandwidth 
      available the route is granted provided the trunks are operational 
      and there are sufficient Logical Channels (LChs).
      
      The forced pathType could result in over committing the reserved 
      bandwidth allowed on a trunk. A better way to achieve the effects of 
      a forced pathType is to use a manual pathType with setupPriority = 
      0 and holdingPriority = 0. In this manner the path will reserve 
      correct bandwidth and it will bump other paths if required while not

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute reflects the last tear down reason for a connection 
      (LCo). In many cases this displays the reason for a momentary 
      service interruption. This attribute applies to the last path failure 
      only. If a path is no longer up, this may give an indication to the 
      reason that the path has failed. In many cases an alarm will also be 
      generated with more specific information. The following is a brief 
      description of the reasons:
      none - This path has no information for the teardown this is typical 
      of a path provisioned with no remoteName that has not been up.
      normalShutDown - This path has gone down due to normal call 
      termination.
      insufficientTxLcOrBandwidth - At present there is either no 
      available bandwidth or logical channel numbers available on one or 
      more of the trunks for this path in the transmit direction.
      insufficientRxLcOrBandwidth - At present there is either no 
      available bandwidth or logical channel numbers available on one or 
      more of the trunks for this path in the receive direction.
      trunkFailure- A trunk on the path has failed or has gone down due 
      to a provisioning change of a critical attribute.
      trunkCardFailure- A trunk FP card has failed along the path.
      accessCardFailure- The FP on which the peer access service was 
      running has failed.
      operatorForced- The path has terminated due to the operator 
      locking a trunk along the path.
      lostLcnClash- The path has terminated because the PA's at both 
      ends of an intermediate trunk have allocated the same LC to 
      different calls. When this happens both calls must go down and then 
      try to come up again a fraction of a second later (effectively 
      ensuring that they will now be assigned different LC's). It is normal 
      to get the odd clash especially when the PA's usedLC is 
      approaching the PA's maxLC.
      networkCongestion - The path has failed due to control information 
      being lost and not recoverable.
      trunkNotFound - Occurs on a manual path usually. Check for 
      trunks not up or names provisioned incorrectly.
      farEndNotFound - The far end is not provisioned or is not up. 
      Check remote Name.
      wrongModuleReached - This may occur on a manual path. Check 
      provisioning for correct trunk and service names. For a normal 
      path, the network Topology may be changing check remoteName.
      farEndBusy - The far end has been reached but it is busy. Check 
      remoteName and remote end provisioning.
      callLoopedBack - This LCo is provisioned to call itself. Re-
      provision since this is invalid.
      unknownReason - The failure was not resolved.
      farEndNotReady - The remote end was reached but the connection 
      was refused due to the remote end not being enabled.
      remoteNameMismatch - The remote end has alarmed and rejected 
      this setup due to remoteName provisioning.
      serviceTypeMismatch - The remote Service Type does not match 
      this service type. Check provisioning.
      reconnectFromFarEnd - The remote end re-established this 
      connection. Check the remote end lastTearDownReason to 
      determine the real reason.
      bumped - Another call bumped this path from a trunk to get 
      bandwidth (or an LC) which it required to come up. This other path 
      had a higher setupPriority than this path's holdingPriority hence it 
      was allowed to steal the bandwidth (or LC) from this path.
      optimized - This call has been rerouted due to the optimization 
      feature. The call is still active this just indicates why the path 
      changed.
      trunkOrFarEndDidNotSupportMode - This call was unable to 
      complete because a mode required by the service was not supported 
      by one of the trunks the route went through or by the far end service 
      it connected to. Currently the only mode that this applies to is the 
      map/mux mode on TRUNK PA ATM component. Map mode was 
      required by the application (CES/FrAtm etc.) but was not available 
      on the TRUNK PA ATM component through which the call was 
      routed or the far end CES/FrAtm component did not specify the 
      same mode."

   STATUS     mandatory
   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute displays whether the application is set to tolerate 
      momentary interruption of a path while a new path is selected. If 
      disconnectConnection is displayed, the application is informed as 
      soon as possible about a failure by disconnection. If the attribute 
      displays reRoutePath, the path may attempt an immediate reroute, 
      provided the failure is a recoverable failure. If rerouting fails the 
      application is informed of the failure. 
      With this option set to reRoutePath the LCo may wait up to 30 
      seconds before informing the service of complete disconnection in 
      order to allow both ends to attempt to reconnect. Note that if PLC 
      components are different at both ends only the calling end is 
      allowed to reconnect.
      
      All pathTypes respect this attribute. Also on a manualPath with 
      both ends provisioned with independent paths (at least with respect 
      to the failure) this option will have the desired effect that the path is 
      rerouted without complete disconnection at both ends"
