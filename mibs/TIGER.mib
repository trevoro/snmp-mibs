		DESCRIPTION
			"When set to 'clear' all of TIGERs statistics are cleared to zero.
			It will affect each of the ports statistics herarcially, and also
			AUTIF statistics.

			When read, this object should always return 'cleared' indicating that
			the clear operation took place.  Should the operation be defered, the
			value will remain as 'clear' until such time as:

				1/ all of the statistics have actually been zeroed, and
				2/ tigClearStatsTime has been updated with the correct time.

			Should an NMS read the object and receive a 'cleared' indication, the SNMP agent
			will set this object to 'cleared-confirmed'.  This aids the NMS in determining
			whether or not the agent successfully received subsequent clear request.

			Normal operation would be:

			NMS								Agent

			set 'clear'			-->			set to 'clear,' perform clearing
													.
			read				-->					.
			'clear'				<--					.
											clearing complete, set to 'cleared'
													.
			read				-->					.
			'cleared'			<--			set to 'cleared-confirmed'
													.
			read				-->					.
			'cleared-confirmed'	<--					.


			Rules:
				1/ NMS must read 'cleared-confirmed' BEFORE attempting
				   to set 'clear'.
				2/ After setting 'clear' the NMS must read 'cleared'.
				   then the NMS must read 'cleared-confirmed'.
			In this manner, if a 'clear' command was missed by the agent,
			the variable will still be set to either 'cleared' or 'cleared-confirmed'."
