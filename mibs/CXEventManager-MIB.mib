cxEvmLoggingCPU OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX  INTEGER (0..16)
	ACCESS  read-write
	STATUS  mandatory
	DESCRIPTION
"Determines whether the events generated by the software will be logged
locally or on a centralised CPU card within the chassis.  

A value of 0 or a value equal to the local slot number will enable local 
Event Manager processing (events filtering, logging and trap generation). 
Other values determines the central Event Manager CPU slot number (1 to 16).
When central Event Manager is enabled, all the events manager messages are
filtered locally and then sent to the CPU card specified by this object for 
recording.

Centralised event manager is avaliable only in CX1000 and CX2000 products.  
In single CPU units, like the CX900 or the CX950, the value will be fixed 
to 0 allowing local Event Manager processing only.

A log file can be read by the console through UI module.  The syntax of  
the reading command is defined as follows:

Command:	readlog    <logfile>   <option>

Where:	<logfile>   - the name of the logfile which contains the events information.
		<option>    - optionnal parameter: 0 to read (default), 1 to read and delete
		              items as they are read, and 2 to delete the enntire file.

cxEvmTriggerFunction OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX  INTEGER (0..255)
	ACCESS  read-write
	STATUS  mandatory
	DESCRIPTION
"Activates the Event Manager triggering mechanism.  This triggering mechanism 
will send a MSG_EVM_TRIG type message that will contain cxEvmTriggerFunction 
and cxEvmTrigDestSapId to the module specified by cxEvmTrigDestTaskId.  

Events manager functions are defined by module programmer for each module and are used
to generate event to be sent to the Event Manager when specific conditions occurs 
such as errors, status, etc... .                                        

Since writing this object will send a function trigger, it should be used carefully by
advised users only.

a pointer to this table.

You cannot modify this object. It is a display that the software provides.

The first entry of the table is reserved by the event manager as a 
special log file for screen display of the events.  You can define 
up to 19 logfiles.  

After a coldstart, a default logfile (LOG1.EVM) is defined in the second entry 
of the table and will record all events. When an entry of the filetable is activated, 
a file is created with the filename LOGx.EVM where 'x' is the index of the table.

	ACCESS  read-write
	STATUS  mandatory
	DESCRIPTION
"Determines the maximum size, in KBytes, of the logfile specified by 
cxEvmLogFileId.

When determining the size you must take into consideration the size of all 
existing logfiles. The maximum size of a single file can not exceed 
1000 Kbytes, and the sum of all the logfiles size cannot exceed 10 % of the
memory available after system initialisation.  This number can vary according 
to the product, the hardware configuration, and to the software used.  

It is the responsability of the user to verify that the memory size 
specified is allowed by the system.  If the system can not allow the
specified memory size, the memory size value will be downsized automatically
by the software.

Note: After a reset, the system must re-evaluate the RAM distribution and 
therefore it can reduce the maximum size value according to the memory
available.
