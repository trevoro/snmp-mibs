--
--
--  The following is the structure for a MIB for the DEChub 90 and DECagent 90.
--
--  The DEChub 90 is a Ethernet hub with repeater, bridge and terminal server
--  modules.  SNMP Management of the hub is provided by the DECagent 90, a
--  management module which resides in the hub (or optionally on the same LAN
--  as the hub).  The DECagent 90 also provides proxy SNMP management for
--  multiple hubs and for stand alone modules which are not installed in a hub. 
--  
--  The DECagent 90 (the "agent") uses multiple community strings to proxy for
--  hubs and/or modules.  Each hub and standalone module uses a distinct pair
--  of {read-only, read-write} community strings. All SNMP requests are sent to
--  the agent, and the agent uses the PDUs community string to determine the
--  destination and the access level for the request.  Standalone modules are
--  treated as a hub with one slot.  The community table in the da90 group is
--  used to manage the community strings and access to communities.
--
--  Each community contains one hub. The dh90 (DEChub 90) group describes the
--  hub and the contents of the hub. The dh90SlotTable contains a row for each
--  slot in the hub and provides information on the module installed in that
--  slot (type, id, version, MAC address, etc).
--
--  Repeater and bridge management is accomplished via the standard bridge MIB
--  and via DEC extensions in the drpt90PortTable (repeater port table),
--  db90system group (system-like variables for the bridge), dbIfTable
--  (interface-like variables for the bridge) and the db90bridge group
--  (characteristics, statistics, counters, spanning tree, interface and
--  protocol filter information and control).
--
--  Terminal server management is primarily provided through the standard
--  char-like and rs232-like MIBs.  There is also additional server information
--  and management controls provided in the ds90LModuleTable, ds90LPortTable
--  and the ds90LSessionTable.
--
--  The following MIB-II interfaces group restrictions should be noted for
--  proxied devices which have entries in the MIB-II interface table:
--
--  An ifAdminStatus of down(2) is not supported for terminal servers and
--  agents.  Setting this value to down(2) is supported only for bridge ports.
--  Note that setting a bridge port to down(2) may affect communications
--  between the agent and your management station.  Be certain to check your
--  configuration before setting these ports to down(2).
--
--  An ifAdminStatus of testing(3) is not supported by any of the proxied
--  devices.

-- dh90 Group
--
--      The dh90 variables contain information used to manage each DEChub 90.
--      A DEChub 90 can contain multiple devices such as bridges, terminal
--      servers and repeaters.  The DECagent 90 is a module which provides
--      proxy SNMP management for each of these devices.  A single DECagent
--      can manage multiple hubs, in which case each hub is a separate
--      community identified by unique community strings.  The dh90 group then
--      provides management information not only for each hub, but also for the
--      communities used to identify each hub.
--
--      The DECagent 90 can also manage individual bridge and terminal server
--      modules which are not resident in a hub.  In this case, each bridge or
--      server is its own community with its own community strings and is a
--      community of type standAloneCommunity(3).
--
--      Note also that 2 DEChub 90s can be connected and managed as a single
--      16-slot hub.  The dh90Type value for both is dechub90(4), and either 8
--      or 16 is set as the value for dh90NumberSlots.  When a community is
--      created, dh90NumberSlots has a value of 8 by default.

-- !! IMPORTANT NOTE FOR SOME MIB COMPILERS !!
--
-- The VARIABLES list has been commented out of the following two trap
-- definitions because some MIB compilers cannot compile trap definitions that
-- specify a VARIABLES list containing objects that are external to this MIB.
--
-- If your MIB compiler can properly compile trap definitions with a VARIABLES
-- list containing external objects, you should uncomment the VARIABLES list
-- for these two trap definitions.  If you do so, you must also uncomment the
-- IMPORTS near the beginning of this MIB which import the required objects
-- from their respective RFC.
--
-- Note that regardless of how this MIB is compiled into your NMS application,
-- the trap PDU generated by the DECagent 90 for these traps will contain a
-- varbind list with the objects specified in the VARIABLES list along with
-- their values.  It is up to the trap handler on the NMS to decide what to do
-- with this information.
