          }
          ACCESS  read-write
          STATUS  mandatory
          DESCRIPTION
              "This object determines the mode the IP protocol layer
              operates in.  When in multipleNet mode, the system will
              accept different network addresses for each of its
              interfaces.  Routing may be disabled (via ipForwarding), 
              but the system will still be in routing mode, i.e., it 
              will keep all of its assigned addresses and it may 
              still participate in routing update protocols (if 
              configured).  When in singleNet mode, the IP address
              assigned to interfaces 1 is applied to all interfaces.  
              ipForwarding can only be disabled, and all RIP parameters, 
              other than those related to listening, will be ignored.
              Note, when the value of this object is changed, the new
              IP address must also be set in the same PDU.  This is 
              required to ensure connectivity remains.

              When this object transitions from multipleNet mode to singleNet 
              mode, 
                     1)  ipForwarding is automatically set to not-forwarding,

                     2)  all RIP-IP parameters will be ignored except those
                         related to listening on interface 1.  These parameters
                         will be applied to all interfaces.

                     3)  an IP address must be configured, in the same request,
                         for interface 1.

                         the agent removes all other IP addresses, and the 
                         IP address assigned to interface 1 will apply to 
                         all interfaces.


              When this object transitions back to multipleNet mode, 

                     1)  an IP address must be assigned, in the same request,
                         to one of the ports, 

                         that IP address will apply only to that port
                         to which it is assigned.  

                         The IP address for interface 1 will no longer apply 
                         to all interfaces.
         
                     2)  ipForwarding will stay at not-forwarding, and 

                     3)  all previously ignored RIP-IP parameters will take
                         effect.  In order to actively route packets, 
                         ipForwarding will need to be set to forwarding.

              During this transition, there is the danger that no IP address
              will have been configured for the interface that receives the 
              SNMP requests, in which case, the device will no longer be
              manageable.  For this reason, it is suggested that the IP 
              addresses for the interface that receives the SNMP requests
              be set in the same PDU that sets this object."
