    DESCRIPTION
            "An indication of the virtual data source packet selection
            capabilities of this agent. This object should be set during
            system initialization, and should remain stable until the
            next re-initialization of the agent.

            If this agent supports virtual LAN based packet selection,
            and therefore allows entries to be created in the
            vdsVlanSelTable, then the 'vlanSelect' BIT will be set.  If
            this agent allows multiple vdsVlanSelEntries to be
            configured for a single virtual data source, then the
            'vlanMulti' BIT will be set.

            If this agent supports network address based packet
            selection, and therefore allows entries to be created in the
            vdsAddrSelTable, then the 'addrSelect' BIT will be set.  If
            this agent allows multiple vdsAddrSelEntries to be
            configured for a single virtual data source, then the
            'addrMulti' BIT will be set.

            If this agent supports protocol based packet selection, and
            therefore allows entries to be created in the
            vdsProtoSelTable, then the 'protoSelect' BIT will be set.
            If this agent allows multiple vdsProtoSelEntries to be
            configured for a single virtual data source, then the
            'protoMulti' BIT will be set.

            If this agent supports QoS based packet selection, and
            therefore allows entries to be created in the
            vdsQosSelTable, then the 'qosSelect' BIT will be set.  If
            this agent allows multiple vdsQosSelEntries to be configured
            for a single virtual data source, then the 'qosMulti' BIT
            will be set.

            If this agent supports channelTable based packet selection,
            and therefore allows entries to be created in the
            vdsChanSelTable, then the 'chanSelect' BIT will be set.  If
            this agent allows multiple vdsChanSelEntries to be
            configured for a single virtual data source, then the
            'chanMulti' BIT will be set.

            If this agent supports URL based HTTP packet selection, and
            therefore allows entries to be created in the
            vdsUrlSelTable, then the 'urlSelect' BIT will be set.  If
            this agent allows multiple vdsUrlSelEntries to be configured
            for a single virtual data source, then the 'urlMulti' BIT
            will be set.

            If this agent supports combinations of packet selection
            mechanisms to be used within the same virtual data source,
            and therefore allows entries to be created in at least two
            of the vds*SelTables, then the 'comboSelect' BIT will be
            set."

vdsControlTable OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX      SEQUENCE OF VdsControlEntry
    MAX-ACCESS  not-accessible
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
            "This table contains one row per virtual data source, as
            configured by NMS application(s). It is used to control the
            overall configuration of each virtual data source.

            The agent will maintain a proprietary virtual interface, on
            behalf of each active vdsControlEntry.  All packets which
            are monitored on the 'parent' interface (identified by the
            vdsControlParent object) will be classified and processed
            according to the configuration for each relevant
            vdsControlEntry and associated vds*SelEntries.

            Each of the selection algorithms produces a boolean result
            (i.e., 'selected' or 'not selected'), and these results are
            combined (i.e., logical AND/OR expression) to produce a
            single boolean result for the packet.

            If a packet is selected, then it will be somehow presented
            for monitoring on the associated virtual interface
            maintained by the agent.  Since a virtual interface only
            exists in the RMON agent, it is expected that the same agent
            will be supporting an implementation of one or more RMON
            MIBs, which will allow RMON control table dataSource objects
            to reference the ifEntry created on behalf of a
            vdsControlEntry. The implementation details of this
            'linkage', or any use of this ifEntry other than remote
            monitoring, is outside the scope of this document.

            Additional entries in the vdsVlanSelTable, vdsAddrSelTable,
            vdsProtoSelTable, vdsQosSelTable, vdsChanSelTable, and/or
            vdsUrlSelTable will be required, depending on the
            configuration of this entry.

            At least one selection mechanism must be configured per
            vdsControlEntry. The initial state of all packet selection
            algorithms is 'not selected', therefore a virtual data
            source will have no effect unless a vds*SelEntry is properly
            configured (in addition to this entry).

            NMS applications must configure the appropriate
            vds*SelEntries before activated this control entry, and
            those vds*SelEntries may not be modified while this entry is
            active.

            It is an implementation-specific manner as to the complexity
            and capacity of the entries allowed in this table.  Actual
            configurations will be constrained by agent functionality
            and platform resources."

            source.

            This object must identify a valid SmonDataSource.  Virtual
            data sources cannot be represented in the SMON
            dataSourceCapsTable.  However, the dataSourceRmonCaps object
            in the dataSourceCapsEntry for this entry can be used to
            identify most of the attributes that a virtual data source
            inherits from its parent.  The 'countErrFrames',
            'countAllGoodFrames', and 'babyGiantsCountAsGood' BITs are
            all inherited from the parent data source.  The
            'countAnyRmonTables' BIT is not inherited, as it is assumed
            to be set for virtual data sources.  An agent is required to
            support at least one RMON collection type for each virtual
            data source.

            For each examined packet which matches the network type
            (according to the algorithm defined in the
            vdsAddrSelNetProtoID object):

               1) 'Bitwise AND' each octet of the vdsAddrSelHost1Addr
                  object with each octet of the associated
                  vdsAddrSelHost1Mask value. Note that the result of
                  this step is a constant value, and may be used for
                  all relevant packets, rather than re-computing this
                  value each time a packet is processed.
               2) 'Bitwise AND' this each octet of object object with
                  each octet of the associated vdsAddrSelHost2Mask
                  value.  Note that the result of this step is a
                  constant value, and may be used for all relevant
                  packets, rather than re-computing this value each
                  time a packet is processed.
               3) 'Bitwise AND' each octet of the network source
                  address in the packet with each octet of the
                  associated vdsAddrSelHost1Mask value
               4) 'Bitwise AND' the each octet of the network
                  destination address in the packet with each octet
                  of the associated vdsAddrSelHost2Mask value
               5) (Check if host1 is sending to host2)
                  Compare the results of step (1) and step (3);
                  Compare the results of step (2) and step (4);
                  If the results of step (1) equals the results of
                  step (3), and the results of step (2) equals the
                  results of step (4), then the packet is selected;
                  Otherwise continue to step (6)
               6) (Check if host2 is sending to host1)
                  Compare the results of step (1) and step (4);
                  Compare the results of step (2) and step (3);

            "This table controls how URL based packet selection is
            performed on behalf of particular vdsControlEntries
            configured on this agent.

            All packets which match some encapsulation of HTTP are
            considered for selection. The agent must be capable of
            associating the URL that identifies some amount of HTTP
            based content, to individual packets on a network.  If a
            packet is part of the content associated with a URL that
            matches any of the 'URL strings' within a group (defined
            below), then it is selected.

            All entries with the same vdsControlUrlSelIndex are
            evaluated as a group, and an individual packet is selected
            if the evaluation of any row within the group produces a
            'selected' result.  There is no evaluation ordering defined
            for each row within a group, and an agent may choose to stop
            evaluation after the first 'selected' result.

            It is an implementation-specific manner as to the complexity
            and capacity of the entries allowed in this table.  Actual
            configurations will be constrained by agent functionality
            and platform resources."

            relevant virtual data source.

            If the URL 'scheme' field (e.g., http, https, ftp) should be
            considered in the URL match algorithm for this entry, then
            the 'urlScheme' bit should be set in this mask.  This bit

            considered in the URL match algorithm for this entry, then
            the 'urlHost' bit should be set in this mask.  This bit has
            no affect if the URL host field is not present in the

            the 'urlPort' bit should be set in this mask.  This bit has
            no affect if the URL port field is not present in the
            associated vdsUrlSelString.

            If the URL 'path' field (e.g., /, /sales/reports/, or
