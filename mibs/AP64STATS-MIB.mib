	DESCRIPTION
	    "The best estimate of the total number of collisions
	    on this Ap64ethernet segment.

	    The value returned will depend on the location of
	    the RMON probe. Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and
	    section 10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3
	    states that a station must detect a collision, in
	    the receive mode, if three or more stations are
	    transmitting simultaneously.  A repeater port must
	    detect a collision when two or more stations are
	    transmitting simultaneously.  Thus a probe placed on
	    a repeater port could record more collisions than a
	    probe connected to a station on the same segment
	    would.

	    Probe location plays a much smaller role when
	    considering 10BASE-T.  14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE
	    standard 802.3 defines a collision as the
	    simultaneous presence of signals on the DO and RD
	    circuits (transmitting and receiving at the same
	    time).  A 10BASE-T station can only detect
	    collisions when it is transmitting.  Thus probes
	    placed on a station and a repeater, should report
	    the same number of collisions.

	    Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater
	    should ideally report collisions between the
	    repeater and one or more other hosts (transmit
	    collisions as defined by IEEE 802.3k) plus receiver
	    collisions observed on any coax segments to which
	    the repeater is connected."
