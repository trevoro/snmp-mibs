      provisioned for the operator's user ID. An operator will see only the 
      stream data for components having a matching CID. Also, the 
      operator will be allowed to issue commands for only those 
      components which have a matching CID.
      
      An operator CID of 0 is used to identify the Network Manager 
      (referred to as 'NetMan' in DPN). This CID matches the CID of 
      any component. Values 1 to 8191 inclusive (equivalent to 'basic

      When no values are in the set, this indicates that either the attribute 
      is not supported or that none of the status conditions described 
      below are present.
      
      The value inTest indicates that the resource is undergoing a test 
      procedure. If adminState is locked or shuttingDown, the normal 
      users are precluded from using the resource and controlStatus is 
      reservedForTest. Tests that do not exclude additional users can be 
      present in any operational or administrative state but the 
      reservedForTest condition should not be present.
      
      The value failed indicates that the component has an internal fault 
      that prevents it from operating. The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value dependency indicates that the component cannot operate 
      because some other resource on which it depends is unavailable. 
      The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value powerOff indicates the resource requires power to be 
      applied and it is not powered on. The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value offLine indicates the resource requires a routine 
      operation (either manual, automatic, or both) to be performed to 
      place it on-line and make it available for use. The operationalState 
      is disabled.
      
      The value offDuty indicates the resource is inactive in accordance 
      with a predetermined time schedule. In the absence of other 
      disabling conditions, the operationalState is enabled or disabled.
      
      The value degraded indicates the service provided by the 
      component is degraded in some way, such as in speed or operating 
      capacity. However, the resource remains available for service. The 
      operationalState is enabled.

      doesn't initialize autonomously) that initialization is required before 
      it can perform its normal functions, and this procedure has not been 
      initiated. The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value notInitialized indicates (for a resource which does

-- through Framer, that an application component is associated with a 
-- specific hardware link interface.
-- 
-- The Framer component provides provisionable attributes related to 
-- datapath aspects of the hardware interface (such as crc and frame 
-- length) rather than interface specific attributes (such as modem 
-- leads and clocking) which are associated with specific hardware 
-- components (such as V35/n or DS1/n). The Framer component also 
-- provides a provisionable attribute which binds the application 
-- component to a specific hardware component.
-- 
-- The Framer component contains operational attributes for link 
-- interface datapath statistics (such as frame counts and aborts).
