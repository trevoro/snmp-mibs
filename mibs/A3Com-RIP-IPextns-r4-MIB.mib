-- Import Metric Table.

--  This table specifies how metrics are to be reported when
-- routes learned via other protocols are reported by RIP.
-- Note, this only applies when these imported metrics are not 
-- explicitly specified (ie, when any of the a3RipIp*PolMetrics
-- are set to 0).  When these imported metrics are to be calculated
-- by the system, this table specifies the operations to be performed
-- on the imported metric before it is reported by RIP.
--
-- The operation is determined according to the following formula ...
--
--   RIP metric = (metric from native protocol / operand ) 
--   (if operation is divide)
--
--        - or -
--
--   RIP metric = (metric from native protocol * operand )
--   (if operation is multiply)
--
-- If the output of the operation results in a RIP metric of zero,
-- it is replaced with a metric of one.
