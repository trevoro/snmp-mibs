		"This  object  controls  whether  cut-thru  is  enabled on the
		stack.  Enabling  cut-thru  can  help  to  minimise  the delay
		experienced  by  packets  before  they  are forwarded to their
		destination.  Setting  cut-thru  to 'fastForward' causes frame
		forwarding to begin as soon as 32 bytes of the frame have been
		received. Setting it to 'fragmentFree' causes frame forwarding
		to begin when 64 bytes have been received. This is slower, but
		eliminates  the risk of forwarding an illegally short frame to
		the destination port, however a valid length frame might still
		be  forwarded  even though  it  had a CRC error.  Setting this
		object  to 'storeAndForward' disables cut-thru completely, and
		frames  will not be forwarded until they have been received in
		their  entirety.

		Cut-thru  cannot  operate if the destination port is currently
		involved  in  'cut-thru'  from  another port. In this case the
		device will process the frame in store and forward mode."

		"This is a high level 'Smart' MIB object. This object provides
		a  running  average  of  the proportion of the received frames
		that  are  forwarded.  This value is calculated locally on the
		agent  and  so  does  not require processor bandwidth from the
		management   station  or  occupy  valuable  network  bandwidth
		communicating   with   that   station.  By  default  an  agent
		supporting   this   parameter   will   exhibit  the  following
		characteristics :-

		   (1)  The parameter will be recalculated at approx 60 second
		   	intervals.
		   (2)  Every  calculation  period,  the  device will read the
		   	value of dot1dTpPortInFrames and dot1dTpPortInDiscards.
		   (3)  The calculation will be performed on the most recent 4
		   	samples as follows:
	      4
	      sum (dot1dTpPortInDiscards(i) / dot1dTpPortInFrames(i)) * 1000/4
	      i=1
			which  gives  the  'percentage*10'  filtered, and then
			subtracting this from 1000 to give the 'percentage*10'
			forwarded.
	
		Note: dot1dTpPortInDiscards(i) is dot1dTpPortInDiscards(i) -
						  dot1dTpPortInDiscards(i-1).
		      dot1dTpPortInFrames(i) is dot1dTpPortInFrames(i) -
		      				dot1dTpPortInFrames(i-1).
		The  value  is  expressed  as  a  percentage * 10.  A  default
		threshold  exists  on  this  average  so  that if a calculated
		average  exceeds  85%,  a  trap will be sent to the management
		station.  Further  traps  will  not  be sent until the average
		drops to below 50%.

		A  particular  device  may  provide  the means of changing the
		number   of  samples,  the  averaging  period,  threshold  and
		threshold action if it so wishes."
