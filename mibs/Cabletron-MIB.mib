-- TrapTypes 
-- 
--      This section  will describe  the trap  types  that  the
-- repeater section  of the  IRBM can  generate. These  are not
-- objects, but  Object identifers used to indicate the specfic
-- trap. They  are taken  from the  object space  and are  thus
-- documented here.
-- 
--      The   SNMP    protocol   provides   a   mechanism   for
-- asynchronusly notifying  management stations  of significant
-- changes in  the network.  This mechanism  is the  SNMP  trap
-- message. This  document will describe the general format for
-- all trap  messages that  Cabletron products will generate as
-- well as the specific traps that the will be generated by the
-- IRBM.
-- 
--  Trap Formats
-- 
--      The  SNMP  trap  messages  are  composed  of  two  user
-- definable areas: the specific trap type and the VarBindings
-- (eg. the interesting information). The specific trap type is
-- an INTEGER  that is used to determine the specific trap that
-- has occurred. The "interesting information" contains a group
-- of objects  identifiers (OID)  and their values that provide
-- information about the trap.
-- 
-- 
-- Trap Description
-- 
-- PortSegmenting 
-- 
-- Specfic Trap Type Code - 0x101
-- 
--      When a  port goes from operational to segmented, a trap
-- will be  generated. For  these purposes, the port state will
-- be sampled  every XXX seconds, thus it will be statistically
-- possible to miss oscillating circuits.
-- 
--      The interesting information will include:
--           - Board number
--           - Port number
-- 
-- Trap Description
-- 
--  PortUnsegementing 
-- Specfic Trap Type Code - 0x102
-- 
--      When it  is detected  that a  previously segmented port
-- has gone  operational, a  trap will  be generated.   This is
-- also sampled,  thus a  trap may  not be  generated for  each
-- transition.
-- 
--      The interesting information will include:
--           - Board number
--           - Port number
-- 
-- 
-- 
-- Trap Description
-- 
--  PortLinkUp 
-- 
-- Specfic Trap Type Code - 0x103
-- 
--      This trap  will be generated when it is determined that
-- MAU has  been attached to the MMAC. This is only appropriate
-- for MIMs that support the concept of a link state.
-- 
--      The interesting information will include:
--           - Board number
--           - Port number
-- 
-- Trap Description
-- 
--  PortLinkDown 
-- 
-- Specfic Trap Type Code - 0x104
-- 
--      This trap  will be generated when a previously attached
-- MAU  is  removed  or  powered  down.  Again,  this  is  only
-- appropriate for MIM's that support link state.
-- 
--      The interesting information will include:
--           - Board number
--           - Port number
-- 
-- Trap Description
--  NewSourceAddress 
-- Specfic Trap Type Code - 0x105
-- 
--      This trap  will be  generated when the MMAC detects the
-- existence of a new source address on one of it's ports.
-- 
--      The interesting information will include:
-- 
--           - Board number
--           - Port number
--           - The new source address
-- 
-- Trap Description
--  SourceAddressTimeout 
-- 
-- Specfic Trap Type Code - 0x106
-- 
--      This trap  will indicate that the MMAC has not detected
-- a packet  generated by  this source address within a certain
-- timeout.
-- 
-- 
-- 
--      The interesting information will include:
-- 
--           - Board number
--           - Port number
--           - Source address that timed out.
-- 
-- Trap Description
-- 
--  BoardRemoval 
-- 
-- Specfic Trap Type Code - 0x107
-- 
--      This trap  will be generated when the MMAC detects that
-- MIM has been removed.
-- 
--      The interesting information will include:
-- 
--           - Board number
--           
-- Trap Description
--  BoardInsertion 
-- 
-- Specfic Trap Type Code - 0x108
-- 
-- 
--      This trap  will be  generated when  the MMAC determines
-- that a new board has been inserted.
-- 
--      The interesting information will include:
-- 
--           - Board number
--           - Board type
-- 
-- Trap Description
--  ActivePortInRedundantCircuitFailed 
-- 
-- Specfic Trap Type Code - 0x109
-- 
--      This trap  will be  generated when the active port in a
-- redundant circuit has failed polling. This will indicate the
-- activation of redundancy.
-- 
--      The interesting information will include:
-- 
--           - Board number
--           - Port number
--           - Circuit number
-- 
-- Trap Description
--  RedundantPortActivated 
-- 
-- Specfic Trap Type Code - 0x10a
-- 
-- 
-- 
--      This trap  indicates that a new port has been activated
-- in a  redundant circuit.  This does  NOT indicate  that this
-- port is  usable, but  is being tested. If the port fails the
-- above (3.9) trap will be generated.
-- 
--      The interesting information will include:
-- 
--           - Board number
--           - Port number
--           - Circuit number
-- 
-- Trap Description
--  RedundantPortTestFailed 
-- 
-- Specfic Trap Type Code - 0x10b
-- 
-- 
-- 
--      This trap will be generated when the MMAC executes it's
-- periodic redundancy diagnostics and finds on of the ports in
-- a redundant  circuit  has  failed.  This  message  will  not
-- indicate that  redundancy has  been activated, just that the
-- port has failed and should be fixed before it is needed.
-- 
--      The interesting information will include:
-- 
--           - Board number
--           - Port number

-- TRAP TYPES OBJECT DEFINITIONS
--
-- This section describes the trap types that the bridge can generate. These
-- are not objects, but Object Identifiers used to indicate the specific trap.
-- They are taken from the object space and are thus documented here.
--
-- The SNMP trap messages are composed of two user definable areas: 
--     a) the specific trap type and 
--     b) the VarBindings (e.g. the interesting information)
--
-- The specific trap type is an integer that is used to determine the
-- specific trap which has occurred. The "interesting information" contains
-- a group of object identifiers and their values that provide information
-- about the trap.
--
-- Trap Decription
--
-- 	BridgeStatus
--
-- 	Specific Trap Type Code - 0x0301
--
-- 	When the bridge status changes, a trap will be generated. The
--   interesting information includes the current status of the bridge.
--
--
-- Trap Description
--
-- 	AcqDbaseFull
--
--	Specific Trap Type Code - 0x0302
--
-- 	When the acquired portion of the bridge's filtering database is full, a
--   trap is generated. The interesting information included with this trap
--   is the number of entries in the acquired database.
