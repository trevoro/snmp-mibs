                This tabulates the interfaces within an interface redundancy group.
                All interfaces are indexed according to their physical slot and
                connector designation.  All interfaces in the same circuit act as
                redundant (hot stand-by) interfaces for that circuit.

                At any given time, one hot stand-by interface is chosen to be the
                active interface for a circuit.  The active interface is the only
                interface that is reading and writing data to/from the media."
