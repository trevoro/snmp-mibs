--  Title:  Appian Ethernet MIB
--
--  Dated:  11/8/99
--  Author: D. Theriault
--
--  Description:
--
--  This MIB file contains the definitions and support for the Appian
--  Optical Services Access Platform(s).
--
--  The Ethernet MIB is a single table supporting counter statistics for
--  the access ports.  Statistics support both the dot3 transmission MIB
--  as well as RMON-1 etherStats group which are combined into the Appian
--  specific Ethernet MIB as a single table.
