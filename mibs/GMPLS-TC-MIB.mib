   DESCRIPTION
       "This MIB module defines Textual Conventions
        and OBJECT-IDENTITIES for use in documents
        defining management information bases
        (MIBs) for managing GMPLS networks."

   -- Revision history.
   REVISION
      "200224060900Z"  -- 24 June 2002 09:00:00 GMT
   DESCRIPTION
      "Initial version."
   -- Above revision history to be replaced as below.
   -- REVISION
   -- "yyyymmddhhmmZ" DESCRIPTION "Initial version, published as RFC xxxx"
   -- xxxx to be assigned by RFC Editor
   ::= { gmplsMIB 1 }

   -- This object identifier needs to be assigned by IANA.
   -- Note that MPLS has been assigned an ifType of 166 and that an OID
   -- of 166 has been suggested for the MPLS MIBs.
   gmplsMIB OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { transmission 1 }

-- Textual Conventions (sorted alphabetically).

GmplsFreeformLabel ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
   STATUS      current
   DESCRIPTION
       "This value represents a freeform
        generalized MPLS Label.  This can be used
        to represent label types which are not
        standard in the drafts."
   SYNTAX OCTET STRING (SIZE (0..64))

GmplsGeneralizedLabelSubtypes ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
   STATUS      current
   DESCRIPTION
       "Determines the interpretation that should
        be applied to a label given its label type
        as specified by
        GmplsGeneralizedLabelTypes."
   SYNTAX INTEGER {
      mplsLabel(1),

      portWavelengthLabel(2),
      freeformGeneralizedLabel(3),
      sonetLabel(4),
      sdhLabel(5),
      wavebandLabel(6)
   }

GmplsGeneralizedLabelTypes ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
   STATUS      current
   DESCRIPTION
       "The label types that are defined for
        Generalized MPLS."
   SYNTAX INTEGER {
      mplsLabel(1),
      generalizedLabel(2)
   }

GmplsHopUnnumAddrTypes ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
   STATUS      current
   DESCRIPTION
       "Identifies whether a hop of an explicit or
        reported route uses unnumbered addresses
        and, if so, the type of unnumbered
        address."
   SYNTAX   INTEGER {
      numbered(1),
      unnumberedIfIpV4(2),
      unnumberedIfIpV6(3)
   }

GmplsSegmentDirection ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
   STATUS      current
   DESCRIPTION
       "The direction of data flow on an LSP
        segment with respect to the head of the
        LSP.

        Where an LSP is signaled using a
        conventional signaling protocol, the 'head'
        of the LSP is the source of the signaling
        (also known as the ingress) and the 'tail'
        is the destination (also known as the
        egress).

        For manually configured LSPs an arbitrary
        decision must be made about which LER is
        the 'head'."
   SYNTAX  INTEGER {
      forward(1),
      reverse(2)
   }
