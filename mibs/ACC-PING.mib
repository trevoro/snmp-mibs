			SYNTAX  INTEGER (0..1000)
			ACCESS read-write
			STATUS mandatory
			DESCRIPTION
		" Count of Ping packets left to be
		  generated.  Setting this variable to a nonzero value
		  causes the Ping generator to be (re)started.  Setting
		  this variable to zero causes the Ping generator to be
		  stopped. "

			SYNTAX  INTEGER (4..1500)
			ACCESS read-write

			DESCRIPTION
		" Minimum number of data bytes

			SYNTAX  INTEGER (4..1500)
			ACCESS read-write

			DESCRIPTION
		" Maximum number of data bytes
		  included in the Ping packet.  If this value is
		  greater than accPingDataMin, the data field length
		  of the Ping packet is a random value between accPingDataMin
		  and accPingDataMax.  Otherwise the data field length
		  is fixed and specified by accPingDataMin. "
