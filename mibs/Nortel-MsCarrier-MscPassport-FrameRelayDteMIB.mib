      provisioned for the operator's user ID. An operator will see only the 
      stream data for components having a matching CID. Also, the 
      operator will be allowed to issue commands for only those 
      components which have a matching CID.
      
      An operator CID of 0 is used to identify the Network Manager 
      (referred to as 'NetMan' in DPN). This CID matches the CID of 
      any component. Values 1 to 8191 inclusive (equivalent to 'basic

-- FrDte/n Framer
-- 
-- The Framer component controls link layer framing for application 
-- components sending and receiving data on a link interface. It is also 
-- through Framer, that an application component is associated with a 
-- specific hardware link interface.
-- 
-- The Framer component provides provisional attributes related to 
-- datapath aspects of the hardware interface (such as crc and frame length) 
-- rather than interface specific attributes (such as modem leads and 
-- clocking) which are associated with specific hardware components (such 
-- as V35/n or DS1/n). The Framer component also provides a provisional 
-- attribute which binds the application component to a specific hardware 
-- component.
-- 
-- The Framer component contains operational attributes for link interface 
-- datapath statistics (such as frame counts and aborts).
