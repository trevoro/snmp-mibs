    "A percentage indicating how much the system should oversubscribe buffers
    to queues.  By oversubscribing buffers to queues, a statistical gain can
    be achieved with respect to system throughput.  For example, to oversubscribe
    buffer utilization by 50%, set acSwitchBuffCfgOversubRate to 50.  This means
    that if some queues encounter bursty traffic, they will be less likely to
    drop data.  Using oversubscription involves risking that all traffic flows
    do not burst at the same time.  If this were to happen, some high priority
    traffic could be dropped in favor of lower priority traffic.  Since this
    may be undesirable, the default value for this object is 0 (indicating a
    zero percent oversubscription rate).  A setting of 0 implies the total number
    of buffer credits in the system equals the total number of physical buffers."

    DESCRIPTION
    "A percentage indicating how much of the total system buffer credits should
    be reserved for the default buffer pool.  Since user defined buffer pools
    take buffers from the default buffer pool, setting 
    acSwitchBuffCfgMinDefaultBPSize to a value greater that 0 ensures that the
    default buffer pool will never have 0 buffer credits.  For example, setting
    acSwitchBuffCfgMinDefaultBPSize to 37 will reserve 37% of the total system
    buffer credits (acSwitchBuffStatsTotalBuffCredits) for the default buffer pool."

    is defined as traffic that enters the system on an access port and exits the system

    configured on the same transparent LAN service.  A value of 1 provides the least 
    amount of buffering capacity while a value of 10 provides the most buffering capacity.
