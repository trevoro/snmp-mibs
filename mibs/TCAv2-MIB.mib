                      This object can be used for the following
                      data types:
                      (a) Counters
                      (b) Counters measured over certain intervals,
                          where the Counters are reset to zero at the end
                          of the interval and as a result have the
                          syntax Gauge.
                      (c) Gauges (other than (b))
                      (d) (Enumerated) INTEGER
                      (e) (Enumerated) INTEGER that is used as a bitmap.
                      The enumerated values of this object apply to
                      these data types as follows:

                                          |        possible values        |
                          data type       | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
                      --------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
                      (a) Counter         |   | X |   |   |   |   |   |   |
                      (b) IntervalCounter | X |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
                      (c) Gauge           |   |   | X | X |   |   |   |   |

                      --------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

                      (a) Counter values can only rise. An







                          alarm may be triggered when the value has
                          risen a delta amount within a sample period.
                      (b) IntervalCounter values can only rise within an
                          interval and are reset at the end of the
                          interval. An alarm may be triggered when
                          the value has exceeded an absolute value.
                      (c) A Gauge value may rise and fall. An alarm
                          may be triggered when the value has risen or
                          fallen a certain amount.
                      (d) An INTEGER may assume values in any sequence.
                          An alarm may be triggered when the value
                          does equal or doesnot equal a certain
                          specified value.
                      (e) A bitmap may assume values that represent
                          one or more bits to be set. An alarm may be
                          triggered when the value does include or not
                          include the combined value of certain bits.
                          Note that for (c), (d), and (e) only one alarm
                          needs to be generated, i.e., at first detection
                          of this event."
