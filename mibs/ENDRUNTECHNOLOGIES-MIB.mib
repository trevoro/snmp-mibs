   DESCRIPTION
   "The Time Figure of Merit (TFOM) value ranges from 4 to 9 and indicates
   the current estimate of the worst case time error.  It is a logarithmic
   scale, with each increment indicating a tenfold increase in the worst case
   time error boundaries.  The scale is referenced to a worst case time error
   of 100 picoseconds, equivalent to a TFOM of zero.  During normal locked
   operation the TFOM is 4 and implies a worst case time error of 1 microsecond.

   During periods of signal loss, the GPS sub-system will compute an
   extrapolated worst case time error.  One hour after the worst case time error
   has reached the value equivalent to a TFOM of 9, the NTP server will cease
   to send stratum 1 reply packets and an Alarm LED will be energized."
