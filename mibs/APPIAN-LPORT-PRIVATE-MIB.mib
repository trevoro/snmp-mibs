    DESCRIPTION
    "The logical table is an abstraction of the entity that uses a time slot.
    For an example, a VT1.5 time slot can be used as a DS1 and this DS1
    entity is refered to as a logical port.

    Rows in this table are created automatically when a trunk is activated
    for this OSAP.  The information in this table is local to this OSAP and
    not shared.  Before the trunk was activated, it was configured with 
    a list of logical port index(es).   A logical port index maps directly 
    to a timeslot index from the shared timeslot table.  A row in the Lport 
    table will be created for each logical port / timeslot that is defined 
    in the lport list for a trunk that is used/dropped by this OSAP."
