--      This MIB file contains the definitions and support for the Appian
--      Optical Services Access Platform(s).
--      
--      This mib contains configuration, 15 minute and day statitics,
--      and threshold values for the logical port DS1 for this OSAP.
--
--      The information in these tables is NOT SHARED by OSAPs.
--      All information from these tables that was shared has been moved
