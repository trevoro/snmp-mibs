--
-- changes FOR software release 7.0 (r2 of MIB):
-- 20-oct-93: kxy added support for IPX WAN (incremental update) feature  
-- 13-dec-93: kxy deprecated a3ipxRipControlMapOpt
-- 20-dec-93: ehk returned a3ipxRipControlMapOpt
--
-- changes for software release 7.1 (r3 of MIB):
-- 01-apr-94: kxy added a3ipxPreferredSvrTable
--
--
--
-- changes for software release 8.0 (r4 of MIB):
-- 20-may-94: kxy changed a3ipxSmdsGaAddress such that
--            all zeros is returned if no SMDS address has
--            been assigned.
-- 22-may-94: kxy updated mib to conform to ipx_changes.
--            Specifically:  o ipx*Control objects were made port specific
--                           o ipxRipControl was split into talk ctl and 
--                             listen ctl
--                           o control over Sap talk and listen was added
--                           o control over x25 queue size, VC limit and 
--                             VC timer was removed.
-- 24-may-94: dch : a3ipxRipUpdateTime and a3ipxSapUpdateTime to be 
--		    port-specific. deprecated a3ipxUpdateTime.
--
-- 25-may-94: kxy now, a3ipxRouteTable only displays the primary
--            routes.  Also, when routes are added, it will accept only 
--            primary routes.
--
-- 07-jul-94: kgo : to support IPX DOD spoofing, added new table,
--		    a3ipxSpoofCtlTable (a3ComIPX 11) and its component 
--		    objects.
--
-- 07-jul-94: dch : moved IpxWan/NoIpxWan to be under -ipx CONTrol,
--		    instead of -nrip CONTrol, add HoldTimeMultiplier
--		    under -nrip and -sap.
--		    
-- 29-jul-94: dch : added a3ipxX25configProfId for -IPX X25PROFileid
--		    also rename a3ipxRipHoldTimeMultiple to
--		    a3ipxRipHoldTimeFactor and a3ipxSapHoldTimeMultiple
-- 		    to a3ipxSapHoldTimeFactor
-- 10-nov-94: dch : a3ipxRipHoldTimeFactor and a3ipxSapHoldTimeFactor
--		    now have range (1..24) and default 3.
--
-- changes for software release 8.2 (r5 of MIB):
-- 20-mar-95: kxy:  Added a3ipxDefMetricHops and a3ipxDefMetricTicks to 
--                  a3ipxPortconfigTable.  This is needed to support the 
--                  IPX Default Route feature. Also added a3ipxRipCtl and
--                  a3ipxSapCtl, and deprecated a3ipxSapCtlTalk, 
--                  a3ipxSapCtlListen, a3ipxRipCtlTalk, and 
--                  a3ipxRipCtlListen
