                is determined by the value of sysUpTime at which the basic row
                was last updated.  One instance will exist for each value of
                sysUpTime at the last update time for the row.  A new
                timeMark instance is created for each new sysUpTime value.
                Each new conceptual row will be associated with the timeMark
                instance which was created at the value of sysUpTime with
                which the conceptual row is to be associated.

                By definition all conceptual rows were updated at or after
                time zero and so at least one conceptual row (associated with
                timeMark.0) must exist for each underlying (basic) row.

                See the appendix for further discussion of this variable.

                Consider the following fooTable:

                fooTable ...
                INDEX { fooTimeMark, fooIndex }

                FooEntry {
                   fooTimeMark  TimeFilter
                   fooIndex     INTEGER,
                   fooCounts    Counter
                }

                Should there be two basic rows in this table (fooIndex == 1,
                fooIndex == 2) and row 1 was updated most recently at time 6,
                while row 2 was updated most recently at time 8, and both rows
                had been updated on several earlier occasions such that the
                current values were 5 and 9 respectively then the following
                fooCounts instances would exist.

                fooCounts.0.1  5
                fooCounts.0.2  9
                fooCounts.1.1  5
                fooCounts.1.2  9
                fooCounts.2.1  5
                fooCounts.2.2  9
                fooCounts.3.1  5
                fooCounts.3.2  9
                fooCounts.4.1  5
                fooCounts.4.2  9
                fooCounts.5.1  5
                fooCounts.5.2  9
                fooCounts.6.1  5
                fooCounts.6.2  9
                fooCounts.7.2  9    - note that row 1 doesn't exist for
                fooCounts.8.2  9    - times 7 and 8"

        PortList ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
            STATUS      current
            DESCRIPTION
                "Each octet within this value specifies a set of eight
                ports, with the first octet specifying ports 1 through
                8, the second octet specifying ports 9 through 16, etc.
                Within each octet, the most significant bit represents
                the lowest numbered port, and the least significant bit
                represents the highest numbered port.  Thus, each port
                of the bridge is represented by a single bit within the
                value of this object.  If that bit has a value of '1'
                then that port is included in the set of ports; the port
                is not included if its bit has a value of '0'."

                "A value used to index per-VLAN tables: values of 0 and
                4095 are not permitted; if the value is between 1 and
                4094 inclusive, it represents an IEEE 802.1Q VLAN-ID with
                global scope within a given bridged domain (see VlanId
                textual convention).  If the value is greater than 4095
                then it represents a VLAN with scope local to the
                particular agent, i.e. one without a global VLAN-ID
                assigned to it. Such VLANs are outside the scope of
                IEEE 802.1Q but it is convenient to be able to manage them
                in the same way using this MIB."
