   IppmStandardMetrics ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
      STATUS      current
      DESCRIPTION
       " Each standard metric is identified in the IPPM-METRICS-
       REGISTRY under the node rfc in chronological order. In order to
       allow for several metrics to be calculated in a single measure,
       there is a need to describe in a bit string the metrics to be
       measured.


       This textual convention defines an octet string that gathers in a
       bit string a sequence of bits. The bit order corresponds to the
       order of the metric identifiers in the registry.
       The first bit of the string has the index 0. The index 1
       corresponds to the first metric of the registry
       (instantaneousUnidirectionalConnectivity ).


       Example:
       One-way-Delay(6) is identified as the leaf number 6 of the node
       rfc of the registry. One-way-Packet-Loss(12) is identified as the
       leaf number 12 of the node
       rfc of the registry. A network measure performing both One-way-
       Delay(6) and One-way-Packet-Loss(12) will be described as
       '0001000001000000'b, '1040'B.

   IppmMetricsRegistryIndex ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
      STATUS      current
      DESCRIPTION
       "IppmMetricsRegistryIndex defines an unambiguous index for each
       standardized metric. It identifies a metric, and as such its
       value is the value of the node of the metric in the IPPM
       registry. This value is the same in any implementation of the
       IPPM REPORTING MIB.


       Example:
       In the IPPM-METRICS-REGISTRY, onewayPacketLossAverage is
       registered as the node 14 of ippmMetricsRegistry.metrics.rfc.
       Consequently the index of the metric onewayPacketLossAverage in
       the IppmMetricsTable will always be '14'. At large an instance,
       which type is IppmMetricsRegistryIndex and which value is '14',
       points to the metric onewayPacketLossAverage."

   PacketType  ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
     STATUS       current
     DESCRIPTION
       "This textual convention is a display string used to describe the
       protocol encapsulation list of a packet, and is used as the value
       of the SYNTAX clause for the type of the Src and Dst of an IPPM
       measure. The RFC2895 specifies a macro named PROTOCOL-IDENTIFIER
       for the definition of protocol identifiers, while its companion
       document, the RFC2896 defines a set of protocol identifiers.


       PacketType is defined as a display string. It consists of a list
       of dot separated protocol names. Each protocol name has been
       previously defined using the macro PROTOCOL-IDENTIFIER of the RFC
       2895.


       Examples:
       The RFC2896 defines the protocol identifiers 'ether2', 'ip',
       'ipip4', 'udp', 'tcp', 'telnet'...


       The PacketType of the source address corresponding to telnet is
       the string 'ip.tcp.telnet'.


       The PacketType of the source address corresponding to UDP packets
       sent in an IP tunnel is the string 'ip.ipip4.udp'.


       Note:
       An IPPM measure is active, so generally a PacketType value does
       not describe the link layer (i.e. ether2...). Valid Internet
       packets are sent from Src to Dst. Then the choice of the link
       layer relies on the Internet stack."

   PacketTypeAddress ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
     DISPLAY-HINT "255a"
     STATUS       current
     DESCRIPTION
       "This textual convention is a Display string used to describe the
       parameters of the protocol encapsulation list of a packet,
       basically the address.


       PacketTypeAddress is defined as a display string. It consists in
       a list of blank separated addresses that reflect the
       encapsulation of the PacketType. Each parameter in the list
       corresponds to a parameter of a PROTOCOL-IDENTIFIER of the
       PacketType.
       Example:
       The PacketType 'ip.ipip4' has 2 parameters. A valid
       PacketTypeAddress value is '192.168.1.1 128.2.6.7'."

     IppmMetricResultFilter ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
     STATUS        current
     DESCRIPTION
     "Given that not all results from a metric measurement are
        pertinent, and that the size of the history must be limited whenever
        possible, the TC IppmMetricResultFilter defines basic filters to
        limit the among of data collected:


        Filter's parameters are the 2 fields ippmAggrMeasureLowThreshold and
        ippmAggrMeasureLowThreshold of the aggregated measure setup.


        A filter determines if the result of the current aggregation has to
        be stored:


        LogInBandValue:
        The value is stored if it is lower than the high threshold of
        the aggregated measure setup and greater than the low
        threshold of of the aggregated measure setup.


        LogOutBandValue:
        The value is stored if it is greater than the high threshold
        of the aggregated measure setup or lower than the low
        threshold of the aggregated measure setup.
        LogAboveValue:
        The value is stored if it is greater than the high threshold
        of the aggregated measure setup.


        LogBelowValue:
        The value is stored if it is lower than the low metric
        threshold field of the aggregated measure setup.


        logUpAndDownValue:
        This filter stores contiguous results that are on opposite
        sides of the up and down metric thresholds:
             A result is stored if it is the first result aggregated:
        If it is greater than the high threshold and lower than the
        low threshold then its value is set to the value of the low
        threshold;


             A result greater than the high threshold is stored if the
        previous result is lower than the low threshold;


             A result lower than the low threshold is stored if the
        previous result is greater than the high threshold;

          is not null and points to a notification.
          A fast report consists of sending by email to the owner of the
          measure, a table of the results of all the metrics computed by
          this aggregated measure. The owner email address is read from
          the ippmOwnersTable.


          ippmAggrMeasureFastReport identifies the notification which
          defines the header of the report.


          The results part of the report is made of a column of results
          per metrics. Results are separated using commas.


          To avoid disaster, an aggregated measure using a fast report
          must have a cycle of aggregation greater than or equal to 1
          second and should not sent more than an email every 5 minutes
