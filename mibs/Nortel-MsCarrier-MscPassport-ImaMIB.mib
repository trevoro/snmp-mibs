-- Lp/n InverseMultiplexerAtm/n
-- Lp/n Ds3/n InverseMultiplexerAtm/n
-- 
-- This component is used to define an inverse multiplexing for ATM 
-- (IMA) group. IMA provides a data rate greater than DS1 E1 in 
-- increments of DS1 E1. To use IMA on an 8pDS1E1 function 
-- processor, add Lp/n InverseMultiplexerAtm/n. To use IMA on a 
-- 4pDS3ChAtm function processor, add Lp/n Ds3/n 
-- InverseMultiplexerAtm/n.
-- 
-- The instance range 0..29 applies to Multi-Service Access cards, and 
-- the instance range 0..7 applies to all other cards.
-- The instance number of an IMA group must not be the same as the 
-- instance number of a DS1/E1 "ATM UNI port" under the same Lp. 
-- An "ATM UNI port" is a DS1 or E1 component with a single Chan 
-- whose applicationFramer attribute is linked to an AtmIf component.
-- On a Multi-Service Access card, ports that are used as IMA links 
-- have two immiscible sub-ranges: 0..15 and 16..31. The instance 
-- number of an IMA group must be in the same sub-range as all of its 
-- ports.

      otherwise the component inherits the CID of its parent. The top-
      level component has a CID of 0.
      
      Every operator session also has a CID, which is the CID 
      provisioned for the operator's user ID. An operator will see only the 
      stream data for components having a matching CID. Also, the 
      operator will be allowed to issue commands for only those 
      components which have a matching CID.
      
      An operator CID of 0 is used to identify the Network Manager 
      (referred to as 'NetMan' in DPN). This CID matches the CID of 
      any component. Values 1 to 8191 inclusive (equivalent to 'basic

      loopCode pattern to cause the remote end to apply a loopback, after 
      which the local end should receive the loopCode pattern. The exact 
      pattern used to request loopCode depends on the test type. This 
      failure indicates a high rate of transmission errors, or that the 
      remote end has failed to apply the loopback.
      
      patternSyncFailed indicates that the local end failed to synchronize 
      to the frmPatternType test pattern, that should have been looped 
      back at the remote end. This failure indicates a high rate of 
      transmission errors or the absence of a loopback.
      
      patternSyncLost indicates that the local end gained and then lost 
      synchronization to the returned frmPatternType test pattern. This 
      failure indicates a sudden increase in transmission errors, frame 
      slippage, or the removal of an existing loopback.
      
      unknown is set when a reason to terminate other than those listed

      number of bit errors in any errored frame which is identifiable. The 
      statistics will be updated accordingly. A lost frame (may be due to 
      an error on the flag sequence) will be discarded for the bit error rate 
      calculation. The result is presented in the form of xEsyy, where x is 
      the mantissa, syy is the exponent, for example 0E+00, 2E-09.
      Note that the bitErrorRate is an estimate only. For more reliable test

      lods: the link is in loss of delay synchronization (LODS) state; that 
      is, it has exhibited a differential delay which is greater than the 
      maximum differential delay tolerated by the IMA group. It must be 
      noted that hysteresis is used for the LODS condition.
      protocolError: the link is down because of a time-out or because 
      bad values are being received in IMA Control Protocol (ICP) cells.
      remoteFailure: the far end link is down.
      misconnected: the link is down because the IMA group has 
      declared, after using its transmit test pattern procedure, that this link 
      is not properly connected. This value can occur only if the protocol 
      for the IMA group is atmForum10.
      unsupportedFrameLength: the link is down because it is receiving 
      from the far end a frame length which is not supported by the local 
      IMA group. This value can occur only if the protocol for the IMA 
      group is atmForum10.
      unsupportedSymmetry: the link is down because it is receiving 
      from the far end a group symmetry which is not supported by the 
      local IMA group. This value can occur only if the protocol for the 
      IMA group is atmForum10.

      which the local end should receive the loopCode pattern. The exact 
      pattern used to request loopCode depends on the test type. This 
      failure indicates a high rate of transmission errors, or that the 
      remote end has failed to apply the loopback.
      
      patternSyncFailed indicates that the local end failed to synchronize 
      to the frmPatternType test pattern, that should have been looped 
      back at the remote end. This failure indicates a high rate of 
      transmission errors or the absence of a loopback.
      
      patternSyncLost indicates that the local end gained and then lost 
      synchronization to the returned frmPatternType test pattern. This 
      failure indicates a sudden increase in transmission errors, frame 
      slippage, or the removal of an existing loopback.

      number of bit errors in any errored frame which is identifiable. The 
      statistics will be updated accordingly. A lost frame (may be due to 
      an error on the flag sequence) will be discarded for the bit error rate 
      calculation. The result is presented in the form of xEsyy, where x is 
      the mantissa, syy is the exponent, for example 0E+00, 2E-09.
      Note that the bitErrorRate is an estimate only. For more reliable test

      applied and it is not powered on. The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value offLine indicates the resource requires a routine 
      operation (either manual, automatic, or both) to be performed to 
      place it on-line and make it available for use. The operationalState 
      is disabled.
      
      The value offDuty indicates the resource is inactive in accordance 
      with a predetermined time schedule. In the absence of other 
      disabling conditions, the operationalState is enabled or disabled.
      
      The value degraded indicates the service provided by the 
      component is degraded in some way, such as in speed or operating 
      capacity. However, the resource remains available for service. The 
      operationalState is enabled.
      
      The value notInstalled indicates the resource is not present. The 
      operationalState is disabled.

      defined as a multi-valued set, at most one value is shown to the user.
      
      When no values are in the set, this indicates that either the attribute 
      is not supported or that none of the status conditions described 
      below are present.
      
      The value initializationRequired indicates (for a resource which 
      doesn't initialize autonomously) that initialization is required before 
      it can perform its normal functions, and this procedure has not been 
      initiated. The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value notInitialized indicates (for a resource which does 
      initialize autonomously) that initialization is required before it can 
      perform its normal functions, and this procedure has not been 
      initiated. The operationalState may be enabled or disabled.
      
      The value initializing indicates that initialization has been initiated 
      but is not yet complete. The operationalState may be enabled or 
      disabled.
      
      The value reporting indicates the resource has completed some 
      processing operation and is notifying the results. The 
      operationalState is enabled.
      
      The value terminating indicates the component is in a termination 
      phase. If the resource doesn't reinitialize autonomously, 
      operationalState is disabled; otherwise it is enabled or disabled.
