              device will not authenticate itself to the remote
              peer.  If the remote peer requests authentication,
              the request will be rejected, and if the remote peer

              If the value of this object is 'authPAP(2)', the
              device will use the Password Authentication
              Protocol (PAP) described in RFC 1334 to authenticate itself
              to the remote peer.  The connProfPppSendAuthName and

              Password, respectively, that this device will send to
              the remote peer in PAP Authenticate-Request packets
              during the Authentication Phase of PPP link establishment.

              If the value of this object is 'authCHAP(3)', the
              device will use the Challenge-Handshake Authentication
              Protocol (CHAP) described in RFC 1334 to authenticate
              itself to the remote peer.  The connProfPppSendAuthName
              object indicates the Name that the device will use to
              identify itself in a CHAP Response packet; the
              connProfPppSendAuthSecret object indicates the Secret that
              the device will use to compute the Response Value that
              it sends to the remote peer in a CHAP Response packet.

              If the remote peer requests the use of a different
              authentication protocol than the one specified by the
              value of this object, the request will be rejected."

              peer in its PAP Authenticate-Request packet to the
              connProfPppRecvAuthName and connProfPppRecvAuthSecret

              entry, the call will be accepted, and the connection
              will be governed by the parameters specified by
              the connProfileTable entry.  If the device is unable

              the remote peer to authenticate
              itself using the Challenge-Handshake Authentication
              Protocol (CHAP) described in RFC 1334.  During the
              Authentication phase of PPP link establishment, the
              device will send a CHAP Challenge packet to, and expect
              a CHAP Response packet from, the remote peer.  The
              ansProfChapChallengeName object indicates the Name
              that the device will send in its CHAP Challenge packet.  The
              device will attempt to match the Name sent by the
              remote peer in its CHAP Response packet to the
              connProfPppRecvAuthName object in a connProfileTable
              entry.  The device use the connProfPppRecvAuthSecret
              value in each matching connProfileTable entry to
              attempt to verify the Response Value in the remote
              peer's CHAP Response packet.  If the device successfully
              matches a connProfileTable entry, the call will be
              accepted, and the connection will be governed by the
              parameters specified by the connProfileTable entry.  If
              the device is unable to match a connProfileTable
              entry, the call will be rejected."

    DESCRIPTION

              Setting this object to the value 'invalid(2)' has
              the effect of invalidating the corresponding
              entry in the genericFilterTable.  That is, it
              effectively disassociates the mapping identified
              with said entry.  It is an implementation-specific
              matter as to whether the agent removes
              an invalidated entry from the table.  Accordingly,
              management stations must be
              prepared to receive from agents tabular
              information corresponding to entries not
              currently in use.  Proper interpretation of such
              entries requires examination of the relevant
              genericFilterStatus object."
