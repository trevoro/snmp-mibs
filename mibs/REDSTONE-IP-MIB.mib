        "Coordinate ifIndex value allocation for entries

        A GET of this object returns the next available ifIndex 
        value to be used to create an entry in the associated
        interface table; or zero, if no valid ifIndex value is
        available. This object also returns a value of zero when 
        it is the lexicographic successor of a varbind presented 
        in an SNMP GETNEXT or GETBULK request, for which circumstance
        it is assumed that ifIndex allocation is unintended.

        Successive GETs will typically return different
        values, thus avoiding collisions among cooperating
        management clients seeking to create table entries
        simultaneously.
