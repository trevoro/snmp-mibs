LanguageTag ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
   DISPLAY-HINT "60a"
   STATUS      current
   DESCRIPTION
            "A language tag, constructed in accordance with BCP 47.

            Only lowercase characters are allowed.  The purpose of this
            restriction is to provide unique language tags for use as
            indexes.  BCP 47 recommends case conventions for user
            interfaces, but objects using this textual convention MUST
            use only lowercase.

            Values MUST be well-formed language tags, in conformance
            with the definition of well-formed tags in BCP 47.  An
            implementation MAY further limit the values it accepts to
            those permitted by a 'validating' processor, as defined in
            BCP 47.

            In theory, BCP 47 language tags are of unlimited length.
            This language tag is of limited length.  The analysis of
            language tag lengths in BCP 47 confirms that this limit
            will not pose a problem in practice.  In particular, this
            length is greater than the minimum requirements set out in
            section 4.3.1."
