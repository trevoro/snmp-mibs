                "The textual name of this VLAN, this is the identifier
                that the user of a configuration utility will be using. 
                Using a VLAN ID for the index and resolving to a name
                would be easier for an individual switch.  However, the user
                will not (and should not) use this ID.  The problem would
                then be how to resolve an ID to a Name, given that network
                manager needs to know this for all devices.  Using the name
                as the index allows a management application to have a list
                of names and each network device resolves that to a
                locally significant ID.  This means however, if the user
                configures, via a local interface, two switches with VLANs 
                that have the same name, the network manager will assume
                that they are the same VLAN.
                
                In the future, when the 802.1Q standard comes out, there
                will be a standard way of maintaining globally unique VLAN
                IDs because these will be used as the VLAN tag.  At that
                time the index into this table should become the VLAN tag."
