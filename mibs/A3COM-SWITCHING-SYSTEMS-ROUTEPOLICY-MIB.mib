            directly attached. A value of 2 stands for matches on routes

            The value of this object can be modified at any time. 
 
            Examples: 
 
            1) When exporting from any protocol suite, any route 
            learned in that suite will be advertised if  
            a3ComRoutePolicyOriginProtocol is set to zero and the other 
            preconditions apply. 
 
            2) When exporting from any protocol suite, only routes that 
            were learned from static definition or that are directly 
            attached would be advertised if a3ComRoutePolicyOriginProtocol 
            is set to 3 (mask of 1 + 2) and the other preconditions 
            apply. 
 
            3) When exporting from ip_rip(2), only routes that were 
            learned from rip or bgp4 advertisements would be given out 
            if a3ComRoutePolicyOriginProtocol is set to 20 (mask of 4 + 16) 
            and the other preconditions apply. 
 
            4) If at example 3 we had a3ComRoutePolicyProtocolType set to 
            at_rtmp(7) instead of ip_rip(2), the same value (i.e. 20) 
            would indicate that advertisements under appleTalk 
            rtmp would only include routes learned from rtmp(4) or 
            aurp(16)."

--  Usage Examples 
--  ============== 
 
--  The following examples iterate the instance values for policy entries.  
--  These examples are kept simple to make them more understandable. 
--  If an object is not listed under a given example, assume that object 
--  is irrelevant and contains the default value. 
-- 
--  Example 1: An import (a.k.a. ingress) policy entry that will force the 
--  router to reject any OSPF route advertisement it receives from neighbor 
--  router that has the address 129.63.1.1   Let's also say that this entry 
--  has index 3 under the a3ComRoutePolicyTable. 
-- 
--  Routing policy entry a3ComRoutePolicyTable 
--    Route policy entry index 3. 
--      a3ComRoutePolicyProtocolType.3 ==   ip_ospf(3) 
--      a3ComRoutePolicyType.3 ==           import(1) 
--      a3ComRoutePolicySourceAddress.3 ==  "129.63.1.1" 
--      a3ComRoutePolicyAction.3 ==         reject(2) 
--       
-- 
--  Example 2: An export (a.k.a. egress) policy entry that will force the 
--  router to make all rip advertisements with the actual metric plus 6.  
--  Let's have the policy restricting the advertisements to be only routes  
--  that were learned from static, bgp4 or that are directly attached. For  
--  example 2, let's also say that this entry has index 2 under the  
--  a3ComRoutePolicyTable. 
-- 
--  Routing policy entry a3ComRoutePolicyTable 
--    Route policy entry index 2. 
--       a3ComRoutePolicyProtocolType.2 ==   ip_rip(2) 
--       a3ComRoutePolicyType.2 ==           export(2) 
--       a3ComRoutePolicyOriginProtocol.2 == 19        (see table 1) 
--       a3ComRoutePolicyAction.2 ==         accept(1) 
--       a3ComRoutePolicyAdjustMetric.2 ==   add(2) 
--       a3ComRoutePolicyMetric.2 ==         6 
--        
-- 
--  Example 3: For this example, let's reuse what was given on previous 
--  example and add a further restriction. Assume that the router being 
--  managed has 3 ip interfaces defined, and we only want the route 
--  advertisements of example 2 to come out of 2 of them. In order to do 
--  that, we would define two entries under the a3ComRoutePolicyIpIfTable. 
--  Note that in situations when this table is empty the agent will behave 
--  as if all ip interfaces were listed. 
-- 
--  Assume that the following ip interfaces are defined in the box: 
--  158.101.112.254, 158.101.117.254, 158.101.160.254  And In this list, 
--  the last interface is the one we want filtered. 
-- 
--  Routing policy ip interface entry a3ComRoutePolicyIpIfTable 
--    Route policy entry index 2.158.101.112.254 
--       a3ComRoutePolicyIpIfRowStatus.2.158.101.112.254 == createAndGo(4) 
--    Route policy entry index 2.158.101.117.254 
--       a3ComRoutePolicyIpIfRowStatus.2.158.101.117.254 == createAndGo(4)
