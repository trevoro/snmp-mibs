		      "The state of this TCP connection.

		      The only value which may be set by a management
		      station is deleteTCB(12).  Accordingly, it is
		      appropriate for an agent to return a `badValue'
		      response if a management station attempts to set
		      this object to any other value.

		      If a management station sets this object to the
		      value deleteTCB(12), then this has the effect of
		      deleting the TCB (as defined in RFC 793) of the
		      corresponding connection on the managed node,
		      resulting in immediate termination of the
		      connection.

		      As an implementation-specific option, a RST
		      segment may be sent from the managed node to the
		      other TCP endpoint (note however that RST segments
		      are not sent reliably)."
