-- Some objects in this MIB represent values of timers. 
-- In this MIB, these timers have values in units of hundredth

-- To avoid ambiguity, a data type is defined here as a textual
-- convention and all representation of these timers in this MIB

Timeout  ::=  INTEGER	-- a timer in units of 1/100 seconds.
