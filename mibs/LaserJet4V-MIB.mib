-- This MIB describes all the printer model specific
-- objects suppported by the LaserJet 4V printer                             
-- when networked connected using a JetDirect print
-- server.
--
-- The following MIB also contain objects supported
-- by a JetDirect connected LaserJet 4V printer:
--                                                                           
-- rfc 1213 MIB II
--
-- This MIB complies with the following RFCs:
--
-- rfc 1157 Simple Network Management Protocol
-- rfc 1155 Structure of Management Information
--
-- Notes:
--
-- 1) At the time this MIB was published, a
--    defect existed where the printer would not correctly
--    handle an SNMP get next request.  The printer
--    behavior is correct for tabular objects, but not
--    scalar objects.  For example, energy-star, sleep-mode,
--    and on-off-line are all scalars with OIDS:
--
--    energy-star { dm 1 1 1 1 }
--    sleep-mode  { dm 1 1 1 2 }
--    on-off-line { dm 1 2 2 5 }
--
--    These three objects are the first three objects supported
--    under the dm tree.
--
--    The printer operation (using OpenView tools as an
--    example) is:
--
--      snmpnext hpb18207 .1.3.6.1.4.1.11.2.3.9.4.2.1.1.1.2.0
--
--    with a reply of:
--
--      hp.nm.hpsystem.net-peripheral.netdm.dm.device.system.status-system.
--      on-off-line.0 : INTEGER: eOnline
--
--    which the printer handles correctly.
--
--    However, if the zero is left off the end, then the printer operation
--    is:
--
--      snmpnext hpb18207 .1.3.6.1.4.1.11.2.3.9.4.2.1.1.1.2
--
--    with a reply of:
--
--      hp.nm.hpsystem.net-peripheral.netdm.dm.device.system.status-system.
--      on-off-line.0 : INTEGER: eOnline
--
--    which is incorrect.  The object that should have been returned is
--    the energy-star object, not the on-off-line object.
--
--    Since the OpenView MIB Browser uses the get next command in an
--    attempt to retrieve all the supported objects under the specified OID
--                                                  =======================
--    (object identifier) and the printer returns an object that is not under
--    the specified OID, the MIB Browser assumes there are no objects
--    supported under the specified OID and reports "no value (s) returned for
--    query".
--
--    If you use an SNMP tool other than OpenView MIB Browser to do a get,
--    the printer properly responds.
--
--    Retrieving tables using the OpenView MIB Browser works fine.  Only
--    retrieving scalar objects fails.
--
-- 2) Proprietary Objects containing a string which are defined in this 
--    MIB use the first two bytes to hold the symbol set used to encode
--    the string.  The Roman-8 symbol set has a hex encoding of 0x0115.
--    Other symbol sets are listed in the PCL 5 Comparison Guide in table
--    C-1 Symbol Set Values.  Standard Printer MIB (prt...objects) and 
--    Host Resources MIB (hr...objects) strings do not contain symbol 
--    set information.
--
-- 3) Some of the objects included are only supported if an accessory
--    is installed.  These accessories include:
--      MIO/EIO based accessories
--      SIMM/DIMM based accessories
--      Mass storage devices
--      Paper handling accessories
--      Adobe PostScript accessory

    DESCRIPTION
                "Returns or changes the Energy Star sleep value.  If the
                value is greater than zero, then the device will go into
                energy saving sleep mode after the print engine has been
                idle for the number of seconds specified by this object.
                A value of zero means Energy Star is disabled and the
                device will not go to sleep based on print engine idle
                time.  The value must be non-negative.
                Additional information:
                Returns or changes the Energy Star sleep value.
                The device will go into energy saving sleep
                mode after the print engine has been idle for
                the number of seconds specified by this
                object. LaserJet 4V only supports values of 0, 900, 1800,
                3600, 7200, and 10800.  A value of 0 means
                never go to sleep based on print engine idle
                time.  Setting to an unsupported value causes 
              	the printer to substitute in a snapped value (listed
                			below) and to return <noError>
                			status.  
                			The snapped values are as follow:

    DESCRIPTION
                "A device can support a class of errors called
                continuable errors.  When a continuable error is
                encountered, the device requires a continue event to
                occur before the device will continue operation.  One
                continue event is setting the CONTINUE object to eTrue.
                Devices can support other continue events, like auto-
                continue.  A continue event causes the continuable error
                to be acknowledged, thus allowing the device to
                continue.  Each device needs to list the continuable
                errors.  If the device doesn't currently have an
                unacknowledged continuable error, the response will
                contain <genErr>.
                Additional information:
                LaserJet 4V supports a class of errors called
                continuable errors.  When a continuable error is
                encountered, LaserJet 4V requires a continue event to
                occur before it will continue operation.  One 
                continue event is setting the CONTINUE object to 
                eTrue.  Devices can support other continue events, 
                like auto-continue.  A continue event causes the 
                continuable error to be acknowledged, thus allowing 
                LaserJet 4V to continue.  If LaserJet 4V doesn't currently

    DESCRIPTION
                "Returns or changes the default PCL font width.  Width is
                expressed as the width of a character in centipoints.  A
                centipoint is 1/7200 inch.  Width applies only to fixed
                space fonts.  Pitch, in character per inch, can be
                converted to font width, in centipoints, by dividing
                7200 by the pitch.  The POS indicates the supported
                values.  An unsupported value causes the printer to use
                the closest supported value, causing the printer to
                return <noError>.  ''Closest''
                means the smallest absolute difference.
                Additional information:
                In LaserJet 4V this is equivalent to 'PITCH'.  
                Use the following formula to convert:  
               	PCL-DEFAULT-FONT WIDTH = 7200/PITCH  
               	Setting to an unsupported value causes the printer 
               	to substitute in a snap value (listed below) and to 
               	return <noError> status.  
               	The snap values are as follow:  
               			<=44 snaps to 44  
               			>=9999 snaps to 9999"
