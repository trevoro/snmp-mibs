        -- This type is used for WAN compression ratios.  It represents
        -- the ratio of a raw count divided by a compressed count and
        -- then multiplied by 100. E.g. a raw count of 128 bytes in a LAN
        -- packet that reduced to 40 compressed bytes would yield a
        -- CompRatio value of (128/40)*100 = 320, displayable as a 3.2
        -- compression ratio.
        CompRatio ::= INTEGER

        -- This type is used to represent MBR ports for INDEX clauses.
        -- The valid range is 1..5.

        -- This type represents the long term statistics period that the
        -- MBR is currently using to count stats with an index value of
        -- longTerm(2).  Both a time interval and a divisor can be calculated
        -- from this value.  The time interval represents the number of
        -- seconds in the sliding window for long term statistics.  It is
        -- obtained by the formula:  seconds = 2**(LongTermStatsPeriod + 6).
        -- The divisor is applied to the long term stats raw value to obtain
        -- a per second value.  It is obtained by the formula:
        -- divisor = 2**(LongTermStatsPeriod + 2).
        -- The exception to the above formulas is the LongTermStatsPeriod value
        -- of zero.  The value zero should be modified to the value one for
        -- purposes of the above formulas.
        LongTermStatsPeriod ::= INTEGER (0..6)

        -- This type is used to represent the raw statistics counts available
        -- from the MBR.  The raw counts may be converted into per second
        -- values by using the appropriate divisor.  Short terms stats always
        -- use a divisor of 128.  Long term stats use the divisor implied
        -- by the LongTermStatsPeriod associated with the statistic.
        StatsRawCount ::= INTEGER
