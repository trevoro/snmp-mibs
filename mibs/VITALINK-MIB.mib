        DESCRIPTION
                "This read-only variable displays the current 
                transmit state of the LAN port as follows:

                'initializing': A transient state lasting a 
                few milliseconds after startup.

                'on': A second transient state immediately 
                following initializing.

                'pre-forwarding 1': The first half of the pre-
                forwarding interval. Initial Spanning Tree 
                packets traverse the network and the root is 
                elected. No learning or forwarding takes place.

                'pre-forwarding 2': The second half of the pre-
                forwarding interval. The bridge listens to 
                packets on the network and learning begins, but 
                no forwarding takes place.

                'forwarding': The normal Spanning Tree operating 
                state. The bridge forwards frames on this link 
                and learns from received frames.

                'dls forwarding': The normal DLS operating 
                state. This link is treated as forwarding for 
                Spanning Tree calculations, but the link is 
                participating in VitalinkUs proprietary 
                Distributed Load Sharing (DLS) algorithm. 
                Certain user traffic can traverse the link.

                'backup': Hot standby state. No bridged user 
                traffic is forwarded. The link transmits and 
                receives only certain network management frames 
                that determine if the port should remain in 
                backup or if it should transition to pre-
                forwarding.

                'dls backup': This link is treated as backup for 
                Spanning Tree calculations, but the link is 
                participating in VitalinkUs proprietary 
                Distributed Load Sharing algorithm. Certain user 
                traffic can traverse the link.

                'off': Offline. No traffic may pass on this 
                link, and the line is not used for any internal 
                computations.

                'disabled': The Disable switch (screen /2/n/2) 
                was on when the bridge was initialized. Only
                certain network management frames are 
                transmitted. No user traffic is forwarded and no 
                learning takes place on this link.

                'broken': Communication is not possible over 
                this link. Spanning Tree Protocol computations 
                consider broken links in order to calculate the 
                root priority."
