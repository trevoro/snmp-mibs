-- This MIB module is used to define non standard MIB objects for OSPF
-- Standard mib rfc1253 is extended by these objects to allow proprietary
-- features such as area deletion (ospAreaStatus).
-- Note that area deletion is supported in rfc1580 (next OSPF MIB version)
-- and will no longer be required when the new standard is supported. Note
-- also that the object name ospAreaStatus has been used instead of 
-- ospfAreaStatus, which is used in rfc1580, to allow distinction.
