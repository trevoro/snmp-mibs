-- Routing DpnAddressPlan 
-- This component is a subcomponent of Routing. It resides on all 
-- Passport nodes that carry DPN traffic and is responsible for 
-- maintaining the routing information required to route this traffic.
-- 
-- It is required on nodes that (i) support gateways to RMs and/or 
-- AMs, (ii) nodes that source and/or sink DPN traffic (for example, 
-- nodes which support VC end points), and (iii) intermediary nodes 
-- that simply carry DPN traffic.

      bandwidth on each link; the traffic is not forwarded in an order-
      preserved manner and needs resequencing at the destination, but the 
      available bandwidth in a link group is utilized efficiently.
      
      When this attribute is set to loadspread, DPN traffic is forwarded in 
      an order-preserved manner along a randomly selected route; the 
      traffic sticks to a particular link in a link group, and will not spill 
      over to other links in the link group unless there is congestion on 
      the selected link. 
      
      When this attribute is set to loadspreadFast, DPN traffic is 
      forwarded in an order-preserved manner along a randomly selected 
      route; the traffic sticks to a particular link in a link group, and will 
      not spill over to other links in the link group. Choosing this value 
      may improve throughput but traffic may be discarded in the 
      presence of congestion.

     "This attribute specifies the variance values for high and low metric

      the second path, as a percentage of the best path metric. High and 
      low metric ranges are defined for each COS by the 
      delayMetricRangeBoundary and tputMetricRangeBoundary 
      attributes, and refer to total path metrics.
      
      When a variance value for a certain COS and metric range is set to 
      the default value of 0, only equal metric paths can be used under 
      that COS when the best path metric is in that range. When it is set 
      to a value greater than 0, an alternate path which is safe (that is, 
      non-looping) and which has a metric within this percentage of the 
      best path metric can be used as a multipath.
      
      The special value of 9999 signifies an infinite variance, so that any 
      safe alternate path may be used in addition to the single best path, 
      regardless of its metric."

      This attribute indicates the throughput metrics of up to two paths to

      computed by the routing system based on the sum of the bandwidth 
      associated with the links in the path to the destination. A path with a 
      lower metric value is preferable to one with a higher value as it is 
      associated with higher bandwidth facilities. The metrics displayed 
      are those of the paths being used to reach the destination.
      
      Metric values of 2147483647 for both paths means the RID is 
      unreachable in the throughput class of service. A metric value of 
      2147483647 for the second path only means that there is only one 
      viable throughput path to the destination. A value of 0 indicates that

-- Rtg Dpn AutomaticRouteTester
-- This component is a subcomponent of DpnAddressPlan. It provides 
-- the DPN automatic route testing capability by periodically sending 
-- DPN Ping packets to each reachable RID and MID destination in 
-- the DPN routing table. It monitors if these Ping packets are returned 
-- in a reasonable period of time (about 15 seconds), and analyzes the 
-- route information collected in these packets. 
-- 
-- An alarm will be raised if one or more of the following problems 
-- are detected to at least one of the destinations in the DPN routing 
-- table: 
-- (1) "Timeout"
-- After sending three Ping packets (one round-trip-delay Ping packet 
-- and two path Ping packets) to a destination, none of them return 
-- back in a reasonable period of time. This is referred to as a 
-- "timeout" problem to this destination.
-- (2) "Routing Loop"
-- After analyzing the route information collected in the path Ping 
-- packet(s) that have returned in time ( a path Ping packet logs  the 
-- route information (forward direction only) of all the tandem node(s) 
-- this Ping packet has traversed before it reached the destination), a 
-- routing loop is detected if a specific node appears more than once 
-- on the route. This is referred to as a "routing loop" (sometimes 
-- simply "loop") problem to this destination.
-- 
-- Information about each error destination is accessible via a dynamic 
-- sub-component under this component. If the destination is a RID 
-- destination, it will be ErrorRid/x (where x is the RID vlaue of the 
-- RID destination). For MID destination, it will be ErrorMid/y (where 
-- y is the MID value of the MID destination). The maximum number 
-- of error destinations (counting both the RID and the MID 
-- detsinations) that can be simultanuously tracked (and thus appear 
-- here) is 10. 
-- 
-- Please note that ErrorRid/x or ErrorMid/y only exist as long as

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute specifies the COS type(s) (delay, throughput, delay 
      and throughput) for which the automatic route testing is conducted. 
      
      A description of possible values for this attribute follows:
      none: Do not conduct route testing for any COS type (essentially 
      the automatic route tester is turned off). 
      delayCosOnly: Conduct route testing to each reachable RID and 
      MID destination for delay COS only.
      tputCosOnly: Conduct route testing to each reachable RID and MID 
      destination for throughput COS only.
      delayAndTputCos: Conduct route testing to each reachable RID 
      and MID destination for delay and throughput COSs.
      
      Setting this attribute to 'none' allows the operator to turn off the 
      automatic route tester. Using value 'delayCosOnly' or 
      'tputCosOnly' tells the automated route tester to only work on one 
      COS of the operator's choice. Choosing value 'delayAndTputCos' 
      when both the delay and throughput COSs are to be tested.
      
      The network resources consumption (such as CPU, memory, link 
      bandwidth) of the automatic route tester working on two COSs will 
      roughly be two times as much as working on only one COS. The 
      time to complete a full cycle of route testing to every reachable 
      destination is also expected to be twice as long when working on 
      two COSs."

   ACCESS     read-write
   STATUS     mandatory
   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute specifies the time interval between the successive 
      testson different destinations. The automatic route tester 
      periodically tries to test the route to a different reachable destination 
      (RID or MID). In order not to put too heavy a load on the network, 
      it will wait for a period of time equal to this interval before it will 
      start working on another destination.
      
      The smaller the value of this attribute, the more frequently the 
      automatic route tester gets invoked to work on route testing. On one 
      hand, doing so will reduce the amount of time needed to complete a 
      fully cycle of route testing to every reachable destination. One the 
      other hand, this will increase the resource comsumption of the 
      automatic route tester accordingly.
      
      During each testInterval, the automatic route tester will first retry 
      the routes to each error destination, if any, to see if they have 
      recovered. After the retries of all these error destinations, another 
      RID/MID destination from the DPN routing table (not in the error 
      destination list) will be chosen to conduct route testing only if the 
      current number of error destinations is less than 10. If the number of 
      error destinations has reached 10, no other destinations will be 
      chosen and the automatic route tester will focus on retrying only 
      these error destinations at each testInterval. However, if the routes 
      to at least one error destination has recovered or has become 
      unreachable, the number of error destinations will fall below 10, 
      and the selection and conducting of route testing on another 
      destination from the DPN routing table will resume."
