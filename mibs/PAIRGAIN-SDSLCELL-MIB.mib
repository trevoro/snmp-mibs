-- 03/01/00 1.0     Chirag Barot    Initial Checkin
-- 03/16/00 1.0(2)  R. Wada 		Added Clear, running counters, nextindex,
--                                  removed TC layer.
-- 03/23/00 1.0(3)  R. Wada			Added profile in use flag, alarm status
--                                  table, hardware alarm trap.
-- 04/04/00 1.0(4)  R. Wada		    Added enumeration for hardware cause,
--                                  renamed AlarmLastCleared to
--                                  AlarmLastChanged.
-- 04/07/00 1.0(5)  R. Wada		    Made changes per MIB Review. Added Pg to
--                                  SdslcellLineProfileType and
--                                  SdslcellAlarmProfileType. Moved RowStatus
--                                  objects right after Index objects instead
--                                  of being at the end.  Added "Cell" to
--                                  IndexNext objects, changed inuse object to
--                                  read only.  Changed enumerated type
--                                  inactive from 0 to 1, active from 1 to 2,
--                                  enumerations of pgSdslCellCurrStatus.
-- 05/16/00 1.0(6)  R. Wada		    Changed VarBind contents of trap.
