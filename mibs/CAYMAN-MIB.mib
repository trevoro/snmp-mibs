-- Cayman GatorBox "R6" AppleTalk MIB
--
--
-- 1.	This version of the Cayman private AppleTalk MIB is a duplicate of
--	the AppleTalk MIB in the Kinetics FastPath KStar V8.0 software.
--	This duplication of private MIB variable definitions is done as a
--	courtesy to our customers.
--
--	FASTPATH-MIB { private(4) enterprises(1) excelan(23)
--			 mibDoc(2) fastpath(11) }
--
-- 2.	This is the first release of an RFC1066 MIB with RFC1067 SNMP. It is
--	not yet fully compliant.  It is, however, functional and useful as a
--	monitoring tool.  We plan to release a fully compliant RFC1066 as a
--	point release to the v2.0 GatorBox software.
--
--	The RFC1066 MIB for TCP/IP is also supported with the following
--	exceptions:
--
-- History:
--	Originally created by Steve Waldbusser at Carnegie Mellon
--
--	v1.0	11/89	initially formed from  Kinetics KStar V8.0 MIB
--
--		02/89	cleaned up some syntax errors; changed to be
--			parsable by CMU ASN.1 parser.
--
--		05/89	commented out bogus DEFINITION lines.
--
-- Notes:
--
-- The tcp variables are present but are unsupported; While TCP is present, the
--  SNMP MIB variables are not yet supported.
-- The egp variables are present but are unsupported; There is no protocol
--  support for EGP in the GatorBox.
-- The may be slight inconsistencies about reporting of some variables as
--  we have not yet completed a full review of the implementation to determine
--  compliance.
--
-- scc, alap and ethernet are prefixed by 2 byte interface # ?
--
-- atifTable is indexed by trailing 1 byte entry number
-- rtmpTable is indexed by trailing 2 byte network number
-- zipTable is indexed by trailing 1 byte entry number
