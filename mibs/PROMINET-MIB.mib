-- This data type is used to uniquely identify a resource within the Cajun Switch.
-- It encodes the Resource ID into an OID, using 2 as the first component.
-- Using a 2 works around the OID encoding restrictions of the first component (ASN.1)

   ResourceId ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER

   DisplayString ::= OCTET STRING
-- This data type is used to model textual information taken
-- from the NVT ASCII character set.  By convention, objects
-- with this syntax are declared as having
--
--      SIZE (0..255)

   RowStatus ::= INTEGER {
-- the following two values are states:
-- these values may be read or written

         active(1),
         notInService(2),

-- the following value is a state:
-- this value may be read, but not written

         notReady(3),

-- the following three values are
-- actions: these values may be written,
-- but are never read

         }

-- All representations of MAC addresses in this MIB Module
-- use, as a textual convention (i.e. this convention does
-- not affect their encoding), the data type:

   MacAddress ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE (6))

-- a 6 octet address in the "canonical" order
-- defined by IEEE 802.1a, i.e., as if it were transmitted
-- least significant bit first, even though 802.5 (in
-- contrast to other n802.x protocols) requires MAC
-- addresses to be transmitted most significant bit first.
--
-- 16-bit addresses, if needed, are represented by setting
-- their upper 4 octets to all 0's, i.e., AAFF would be
-- represented as 00000000AAFF.


-- Similarly, all representations of Bridge-Id in this MIB
-- Module use, as a textual convention (i.e. this
-- convention does not affect their encoding), the data
-- type:

   BridgeId ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE (8))

-- the Bridge-Identifier as used in the Spanning Tree
-- Protocol to uniquely identify a bridge.  Its first two
-- octets (in network byte order) contain a priority
-- value and its last 6 octets contain the MAC address
-- used to refer to a bridge in a unique fashion
-- (typically, the numerically smallest MAC address
-- of all ports on the bridge).

-- Several objects in this MIB module represent values of
-- timers used by the Spanning Tree Protocol.  In this
-- MIB, these timers have values in units of hundredths of
-- a second (i.e. 1/100 secs).
-- These timers, when stored in a Spanning Tree Protocol's
-- BPDU, are in units of 1/256 seconds.  Note, however,
-- that 802.1D-1990 specifies a settable granularity of
-- no more than 1 second for these timers.  To avoid
-- ambiguity, a data type is defined here as a textual
-- convention and all representation of these timers
-- in this MIB module are defined using this data type.  An
-- algorithm is also defined for converting between the
-- different units, to ensure a timer's value is not
-- distorted by multiple conversions.
-- The data type is:

-- a STP timer in units of 1/100 seconds
   Timeout ::= INTEGER

-- To convert a Timeout value into a value in units of
-- 1/256 seconds, the following algorithm should be used:
--
--      b  = floor( (n * 256) / 100)
--
-- where:
--      floor   =  quotient [ignore remainder]
--      n is the value in 1/100 second units
--      b is the value in 1/256 second units
--
-- To convert the value from 1/256 second units back to
-- 1/100 seconds, the following algorithm should be used:
--
--      n = ceiling( (b * 100) / 256)
--
-- where:
--      ceiling =  quotient [if remainder is 0], or
--                 quotient + 1 [if remainder is non-zero]
--      n is the value in 1/100 second units
--      b is the value in 1/256 second units
--
-- Note: it is important that the arithmetic operations are
-- done in the order specified (i.e., multiply first, divide
-- second).

-- Event Category Macro
--
-- Indicates the type of event:
-- - coldstart is generated at system bootup
-- - warmstart is generated when the software system (only) resets
-- - system error is generated for a variety of reasons including running out of memory, OS errors, and H/W faults
-- - status change indicates a change in the status value e.g. a port status change
-- - configuration indicates a change in the configuration value e.g. a port mode change
-- - scheduled events are triggered based on a calendar event
-- - authentication indicates attempted access to a restricted resource without the proper credentials, e.g. SNMP
-- authentication failure.
-- - threshold is generated by alarms

-- PORT MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION
--
--    This section manages the physical ports within the system.
--
--    There are attributes that are generic to the physical port class and every
-- physical port in the system supports these attributes.  These attributes are
-- represented in the generic port management section.
--
--    Note, however, that the following operations WILL EACH RESULT IN AN ERROR:
--       Setting promPortMode to disable(2) for an internal(1) port
--       Setting promPortName for an internal(1)) port
--
--    Each type of port may also support other promPortType-specific attributes.
-- If a port supports a particular attribute, there is an instance of that port
-- in the table that manages that attribute.  These attributes are represented
-- in the port tables that follow the generic port management section.
--
--    internal(1) ports do not support any type-specific attributes.

      DESCRIPTION
              "Flow control is used to prevent or reduce the dropping of frames due to
              the lack of buffer space.  Overall, networks are more efficient when a
              sending station is asked to pause in its sending process, rather than having
              the transmitted frames dropped.

              Flow control is not as efficient when used in conjunction with a shared
              ports, i.e. when used with a repeater.  Therefore, flow control is not
              recommended for a port connected to shared topologies.

              Flow control is most effective when the port is directly connected to an
              end-station, especially when connected to a server.  Flow control is
              recommended for ports connected directly to end-stations.

              When the port is in half-duplex mode, back pressure is used to control
              the incoming flow.  Back pressure essentially forces collisions for short
              periods of time.

              When the port is in full-duplex mode, IEEE 802.3 standard pause frames
              are used to control the incoming flow.

              Note that setting an ether-gigabit(4) port to enable-with-aggressive-backoff(3)
              results in an error.

-- Address Database
--
-- The address table provides data that would normally be available from the standard
-- bridge MIB.  The standard bridge MIB has a few short comings, however.
--
-- 1. It is indexed by MACAddress, forcing the bridge to sort a table that is normally
-- hashed.  When the address table is quite large, this sorting can become quite a drag on
-- the processor.
--
-- 2. The bridge MIB address table does not extend well to devices that support virtual
-- LANs.
--
-- 3. There are other objects that are desirable to be managed that the standard MIB does
-- not support.
--
-- This address database  is indexed by address entry  index.  Each address entry has the
-- traditional layer II MAC Address and port binding for that address, as well as some
-- other value added fields such as address priority.
--
-- Each address entry is logically contained by a separate address filtering table (AFT).
-- Separate address tables are important to the support of Virtual LANs (VLANs).  For
-- frames that are explicitly bound to a VLAN either by explicit tagging or by source
-- port association (port-based VLANs), separate AFTs enable a host to
-- appear on different VLANs with different port bindings.  Also, for frames that are
-- implicitly bound to VLANs based on protocol type and/or host address, separate
-- AFTs enable layer III VLANs for client systems.
--
-- In the case where the AFT is supporting a VLAN with a host or host, protocol policy,
-- the VLAN index indicated is the VLAN classification for that host or host, protocol
-- combination.
--
-- Note, it is the default to create separate AFTs for each VLAN and for each protocol
-- type.  In some cases, this may not be desirable and in these cases, multiple VLANs
-- and/or protocols may point to the same AFTs.

      DESCRIPTION
              "The address change table provides a quick way of getting only the entries
              that have recently changed.  Since entries age out as part of the normal
              switching process, entries that have aged (i.e. their destination bindings are
              no longer valid) are not considered to be changed.  Any other modification
              to the entry, including deletion or creation, are considered to be changes.

              The address change table is considered a circular table.  When an entry
              changes, it is added to the next position within the table.  If the 'next'
              position goes beyond the end of the table,  the 'next' position is set to the
              beginning of the table (1) and the wrap counter
              (promAddressChangeWraps) is incremented.  The
              promAddressChangeLast value is updated with the index of the last
              entered entry.

              An entry may be in the table multiple times if it has changed multiple times.
              Every time that an entry changes, it is added to the change table.

              A network management application should follow the following algorithm
              when polling this table:

              1. Set lastChangeWrap = promAddressChangeWraps.
              2. Set lastChangeIndex = promAddressChangeLast
              3. Get the entire promAddressEntryTable.
              4. Submit a getNext for <lastChangeWrap>.<lastChangeIndex>,
              updating lastChangeWrap and lastChangeIndex with the returned next
              values.  Update the address entry database with the changed values.
              5. Repeat step 4 until no more entries are returned.
              6. Wait polling timeout period.
              7. Get wrap events counter and last index.  If the wrap events counter is
              equal to lastChangeWrap, then goto step 4.  Else if the wrap events
              counter is more then one greater then lastChangeWrap, goto step 1.
              Else the wrap events counter is exactly one greater then
              lastChangeWrap, and if the last index is greater then lastChangeIndex,
              then goto step 1, else goto step 4.

              The last step simply insures that we have not missed any of the change
              entries.  Essentially it says that if we have wrapped to beyond where we last
              polled, then we must get the entire table to synch up again.  Otherwise we
              can just get the entries that have changed."
