      3pOC3SmAtm, 3pE1Atm, 3pDS1Atm, 2pJ6MAtm; the number of 
      available connections are distributed equally across the ports on the 
      FP. The number of connections associated to a particular port will 
      limit the size of the Vcc space defined by the ConnMap of the AtmIf

      restricted based on the number of ports on the card. For one port 
      cards, the minimum is 512, the maximum is 4096 and the value

      three port cards, the minimum is 1536, the maximum is 7680 and 
      the value must be divisible by 768.
      
      Increasing the value of this attribute reduces the CQM memory 
      available for cell and frame free list.

      This attribute enables the attenuation of the maximum Cell Delay 
      Variation (CDV) of shaped transmit traffic.
      
      When the value of this attribute is set to off, the CDV value can be 
      determined by the following equation:
      CDV <= 2/ASR + 1/LS

      the Link Speed of the interface.

      changes to the following equation:
      CDV <= 1/ASR + 1/LS
      
      As can be noted from the equations above, setting this attribute to 
      on can reduce the CDV significantly. CDV attenuation may be used 
      to conform to policers which have strict Cell Delay Variance

      This attribute specifies whether port aggregation is turned on or off 
      for this ATM-FP. It applies only to transmit traffic served on the 
      common queues and does not apply to perVc queues.
      
      When port aggregation is on, the enqueue decision of cells or 
      frames to a common queue is based upon the congestion state of the 
      entire port to which the queue belongs. A port is defined to be as 
      congested as the most congested queue amongst all its queues: the 
      low, medium and high emission priority queues. Thus, for example, 
      if the low priority queue is congested, the high priority queue will 
      also experience discards even though the high priority queue may 
      itself not be congested. Setting port aggregation on assures that the 
      low priority queues are also serviced in the event of congestion.
      
      When the value of this attribute is set to off, the enqueue decision of 
      cells or frames to a common queue is based solely upon the 
      congestion state of that queue, not the port. This setting assures that 
      the absolute priority of the traffic is taken into account, regardless of 
      whether or not the lower priority queues are being served."

      A sub-connection is used for interworking the ATM services with

     "This attribute indicates the total receive cell memory size and the

      memory is the memory used for storing ATM cells to be received by 
      this FP.
      
      The first value indicates the total receive cell memory size. This is 
      derived based upon the connectionPoolCapacity and the 
      rxCellMemoryAllocation under the ARC component.
      
      When the rxCellMemoryAvailable attribute decreases to the second 
      value, the rxCellMemoryCongestionState changes from 3 to 2. In 
      congestion state 2, traffic with discard priority (DP) = 3 is 
      discarded. This threshold is set approximately at 25 percent of the 
      first value, the total receive cell memory size.
      
      When the rxCellMemoryAvailable attribute decreases to the third 
      value, the rxCellMemoryCongestionState changes from 2 to 1. In 
      congestion state 1, traffic with discard priority (DP) >= 2 is 
      discarded. This threshold is set approximately at 20 percent of the 
      first value, the total receive cell memory size.
      
      When the rxCellMemoryAvailable attribute decreases to the fourth 
      value, the rxCellMemoryCongestionState changes from 1 to 0. In 
      congestion state 0, traffic with discard priority (DP) >= 1 is 
      discarded. This threshold is set approximately at 10 percent of the 
      first value, the total receive cell memory size.
      
      The opposite effect occurs when the rxCellMemoryAvailable 
      attribute increases (rxCellMemoryCongestionState increases from 0 
      to 3 accordingly)."

      3pOC3MmAtm, 3pOC3SmAtm, 3pE1Atm, 3pDS1Atm,

      When the value of this attribute is set to disabled, the CDV value

      CDV <= 2/ASR + 1/LS
      
      where ASR is the Actual Shaping Rate of the connection and LS is 
      the Link Speed of the interface.
      
      When the value of this attribute is set to enabled, the CDV 
      relationship changes to the following equation:
      
      CDV <= 1/ASR + 1/LS

     "This attribute specifies the congestion behavior of all ports on

      common queues and does not apply to per-VC queues.
      
      When the value is aggregate, the enqueue decision of cells or 
      frames to a common queue is based upon the congestion state 
      of the entire port to which the queue belongs. A port is 
      defined to be as congested as the most congested queue 
      amongst all its common queues: the low, medium and high 
      emission priority queues. Thus, for example, if the low 
      priority queue is congested, the high priority queue also 
      experiences discards even though the high priority queue may 
      itself not be congested. Setting this attribute to aggregate 
      assures that the low priority queues are also serviced in the 
      event of congestion.
      
      When the value of this attribute is set to individualQueue, 
      the enqueue decision of cells or frames to a common queue is 
      based solely upon the congestion state of that queue, not the

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute specifies the high priority Early Packet Discard (EPD) 
      offset for connection queues. On ATM IP FPs a given connection 
      queue is associated with one of eight emission priorities (EP). These 
      include six unshaped EPs, one exclusive VBR shaper EP and one 
      ABR/VBR shaper EP. This attribute specifies the EPD offset for the 
      exclusive VBR shaper EP and the first four (higher priority) 
      unshaped EPs.
      
      This offset is used to derive a connection EPD threshold for a given 
      Congestion Control (CC) level by subtracting the offset from the 
      All Packet Discard (APD) threshold at the same CC level. The APD 
      thresholds are themselves derived from the transmit queue limit.
      
      The EPD threshold only applies to a connection if the 
      txPacketWiseDiscard feature is requested. The 
      txPacketWiseDiscard feature can be enabled only if the transmit 
      queue limit is at least 5.71 times the EPD offset. This ensures that 
      the derived EPD threshold will never be less than 17.5 % of the 
      transmit queue limit. If this condition is not satisfied, 
      txPacketWiseDiscard for the connection will be automatically 
      disabled.
      
      Due to the above constraint, if the operator wishes to decrease the 
      transmit queue limit and still have txPacketWiseDiscard enabled on 
      the connection then this offset must be set to a lower value that 
      meets the above requirement.
      
      Due to hardware granularity the actual value of the EPD offset may 
      not match exactly the value provisioned. The actual value is 
      displayed under the ATM Connection Administrator service

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute specifies the congestion behavior of all ports on this 
      FP. It applies only to transmit traffic and does not apply to the CBR 
      service category. 
      
      When the value is aggregate, the enqueue decision of cells or 
      frames to a queue is based upon the congestion state of the entire 
      port to which the queue belongs. A port is defined to be as 
      congested as the most congested queue amongst all its queues. 
      Thus, for example, if a nrtVBR queue is congested, the rtVBR 
      queue also experiences discards even though the rtVBR queue may 
      itself not be congested. Setting this attribute to aggregate assures 
      that the low priority queues are also serviced in the event of 
      congestion. If this attribute is set to aggregate then rtVBR must not 
      be configured to do common queueing and its emissionPriority 
      should be set to a number numerically smaller than or equal to 3. 
      Another impact of setting this attribute to aggregate is that the per 
      connection queue limits for nrtVBR and UBR connections will be 
      increased to the link pool size and their discard thresholds will be 
      modified to be aligned with the free list discard thresholds.
      
      When the value of this attribute is set to individualQueue, 
      the enqueue decision of cells or frames to a queue is based solely 
      upon the congestion state of that queue, not the port. This setting 
      assures that the absolute priority of the traffic is taken into account, 
      regardless of whether the lower priority queues are being served. On 
      3pOC3SmAtm2 and 3pOC3MmAtm2 cards, if more than one 
      override component exists, they must have the same setting for this 
      attribute. Otherwise, setting the attribute under one override 
      component applies to the entire card."

      fourth value, the rxFrameMemoryCongestionState changes from 1 
      to 0. In congestion state 0, traffic with discard priority (DP) >= 1 is 
      discarded. This threshold is set approximately at 10 percent of the 
      first value, the total received frame memory size.
      
      The opposite effect occurs when the rxFrameMemoryAvailable 
      attribute increases (rxFrameMemoryCongestionState increases from 
      0 to 3 accordingly)."

     "This attribute indicates the maximum number of sub-connections 
      for the LogicalProcessor. 
      
      A sub-connection is used for interworking the ATM services with 
      the frame oriented services such as Frame Relay and Path Oriented 
      Routing System (PORS). When a frame is received at a sub-
      connection, the frame header is modified to be compatible with the 
      service it is to be forwarded to.
      
      Due to limited resources, not all of the sub-connections requested 
      by this attribute may be allocated. The desired number of sub-
      connections allocated is indicated by the sum of fcrc 
      subConnectionPoolAvailable and fcrc subConnectionPoolUsage 
      attributes. 
      
      This pool is used for connection oriented services only. Each of the 
      following components uses one sub-connection from this pool: 
      FrAtm/n Dlci/n Siwf
      McsMgr Frf5EpG/n Frf5Ep/n Lmi
      McsMgr Frf5EpG/n Frf5Ep/n Dlci/n
      
      When the sub-connection pool is exhausted, no more connections 
      are accepted from the services which utilize this pool.
      
      Note: Ip Routing entries also compete for this memory.
      
      The maximum size of this pool is 8192 for CQC based cards. The 
      default cardDependent has the effect of setting 
      subConnectionPoolCapacity to 1024 for both CQC cards and 
      SGAF cards.

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute indicates the maximum number of resource records 
      for the connections which utilize Logical Network Number (LNN) 
      on the LogicalProcessor.
      
      A logical network is a subset of passport modules together with a 
      subset of trunks that interconnect those modules. It carries the 
      traffic for a defined set of network protocols. An LNN is used to 
      identify a logical network. The connectionless services which 
      utilize the logical networks require some processing at the 
      intermediate nodes. This pool is allocated at the intermediate nodes 
      to sustain these connectionless services.
      
      If the McsMgr DprsMcsEpG/n Ep/n EpD 
      transportConnectionPreference attribute is set to atmOnly, each 
      instance of the McsMgr DprsMcsEpG/n Ep/n component uses one 
      resource record from this pool, otherwise it does not use this pool.
      
      Note: Frame and Cell queues also compete for this memory.
      
      Each DPRS instance requires two resource records and each VNS 
      instance requires one resource records from this pool. (A VNS 
      instance is an lnn combined with a trunk).
      
      The maximum size of this pool is 256 for CQC based cards. The 
      default cardDependent has the effect of setting
