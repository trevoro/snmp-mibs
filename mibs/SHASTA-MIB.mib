        DESCRIPTION
                "shastaExperiment provides a root object identifier
                from which experimental MIBs may be temporarily
                based.  MIBs are typicially based here if they
                fall in one of two categories
                1) are IETF work-in-process MIBs which have not
                been assigned a permanent object identifier by
                the IANA.
                2) are shasta work-in-process which has not been
                assigned a permanent object identifier by the
                shasat assigned number authority, typicially because
                the mib is not ready for deployment.
 
                NOTE WELL:  support for MIBs in the shastaExperiment
                subtree will be deleted when a permanent object
                identifier assignment is made."
