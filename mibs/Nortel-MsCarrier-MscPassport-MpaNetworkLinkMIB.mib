      level component has a CID of 0.
      
      Every operator session also has a CID, which is the CID 
      provisioned for the operator's user ID. An operator will see only the 
      stream data for components having a matching CID. Also, the 
      operator will be allowed to issue commands for only those 
      components which have a matching CID.
      
      An operator CID of 0 is used to identify the Network Manager 
      (referred to as 'NetMan' in DPN). This CID matches the CID of 
      any component. Values 1 to 8191 inclusive (equivalent to 'basic

      is not supported or that none of the status conditions described 
      below are present.
      
      The value inTest indicates that the resource is undergoing a test 
      procedure. If adminState is locked or shuttingDown, the normal 
      users are precluded from using the resource and controlStatus is 
      reservedForTest. Tests that do not exclude additional users can be

      The value powerOff indicates the resource requires power to be

      disabling conditions, the operationalState is enabled or disabled.
      
      The value degraded indicates the service provided by the

      capacity. However, the resource remains available for service. The

      it can perform its normal functions, and this procedure has not been 
      initiated. The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value notInitialized indicates (for a resource which does

-- Mpanl/<n> Framer
-- The Framer component controls link layer framing for application 
-- components sending and receiving data on a link interface. It is also 
-- through Framer, that an application component is associated with a 
-- specific hardware link interface.
-- 
-- The Framer component provides provisionable attributes related to 
-- datapath aspects of the hardware interface (such as crc and frame 
-- length) rather than interface specific attributes (such as modem 
-- leads and clocking) which are associated with specific hardware 
-- components (such as V35/n or DS1/n). The Framer component also 
-- provides a provisionable attribute which binds the application 
-- component to a specific hardware component.
-- 
-- The Framer component contains operational attributes for link 
-- interface datapath statistics (such as frame counts and aborts).

   DESCRIPTION
     "*** THIS TABLE CURRENTLY NOT IMPLEMENTED ***

      This group defines Frame Relay attributes collected by Frame Relay 
      Vc.
      The purpose of Vc attributes is to aid end users and verification 
      people to understand the Vc internal behavior. This is particularly 
      useful when the network has experienced abnormality and we want 
      to isolate problems and pinpoint trouble spots. 
      Attributes are collected on a per Vc basis. Until a need is identified, 
      statistics are not collected at a processor level. Each attribute is 
      stored in a 32 bit field and is initialized to zero when a Vc enters 
      into the data transfer state. When a PVC is disconnected and then 
      connected again, the attributes will be reset. Attributes cannot be 
      reset through other methods. 
      Frame Relay Vc uses a best effort data packet delivery protocol and 
      a different packet segmentation and combination methods from the 
      General Vc. The Frame Relay Vc uses the same call setup and 
      control mechanism (e.g. the support of non-flow control data 
      packets) as in a General Vc. Most General Vc statistics and internal 
      variables are used in a Frame Relay Vc and are displayed by 
      software developers"

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute reflects the last tear down reason for a connection 
      (LCo). In many cases this displays the reason for a momentary 
      service interruption. This attribute applies to the last path failure 
      only. If a path is no longer up, this may indicate why the path has 
      failed. In many cases an alarm will also be generated with more 
      specific information. The following is a brief description of the 
      reasons:
      none - This path has no information for the teardown. 
      normalShutDown - This path has gone down due to normal call 
      termination.
      insufficientTxLcOrBandwidth - At present there is either no 
      available bandwidth or logical channel numbers available on one or 
      more of the trunks for this path in the transmit direction.
      insufficientRxLcOrBandwidth - At present there is either no 
      available bandwidth or logical channel numbers available on one or 
      more of the trunks for this path in the receive direction.
      trunkFailure- A trunk on the path has failed or has gone down due 
      to a provisioning change of a critical attribute.
      trunkCardFailure- A trunk FP card has failed along the path.
      accessCardFailure- The FP on which the peer access service was 
      running has failed.
      operatorForced- The path has terminated due to the operator 
      locking a trunk along the path.
      lostLcnClash- The path has terminated because the PAs at both 
      ends of an intermediate trunk have allocated the same LC to 
      different calls. When this happens both calls must go down and then 
      try to come up again a fraction of a second later (effectively 
      ensuring that they will now be assigned different LCs). It is normal 
      to get the odd clash especially when the PA's usedLC is 
      approaching the PA's maxLC.
      networkCongestion - The path has failed due to control information 
      being lost and not recoverable.
      trunkNotFound - Occurs on a manual path usually. Check for 
      trunks not up or names provisioned incorrectly.
      farEndNotFound - The far end is not provisioned or is not up. 
      Check remote Name.
      wrongModuleReached - This may occur on a manual path. Check 
      provisioning for correct trunk and service names. For a normal 
      path, the network Topology may be changing. Check remote 
      provisioned DNA.
      farEndBusy - The far end has been reached but it is busy. Check 
      remote provisioned DNA and remote end provisioning.
      unknownReason - The failure was not resolved.
      farEndNotReady - The remote end was reached but the connection 
      was refused due to the remote end not being enabled.
      serviceTypeMismatch - The remote service type does not match 
      this service type. Check provisioning.
      reconnectFromFarEnd - The remote end re-established this 
      connection. Check the remote end lastTearDownReason to 
      determine the real reason.
      bumped - Another call bumped this path from a trunk to get 
      bandwidth (or an LC) which it required to come up. This other path 
      had a higher setupPriority than this path's holdingPriority, hence it 
      was allowed to steal the bandwidth (or LC) from this path.
      optimized - This call has been rerouted due to the optimization 
      feature. The call is still active; this just indicates why the path 
      changed."
