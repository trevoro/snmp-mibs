    DESCRIPTION
        "Identifies the version of the MIB. The format
         of the version is x.yzT, where 'x' identifies
         the major revision number, 'y'identifies the
         minor revision number, 'z' identifies the
         typographical revision, and T identifies the
         test revision.  Acceptable values for the
         individual revision components are
         as follows

                x: 1 - 9
                y: 0 - 9

    	"The  snmp553AlarmTable contains entries that report the
	status of alarms.  The status of an alarm indicates whether the
	alarm is currently active or inactive.  This information will
	be determined by the network element depending on the alarm threshold
	configuration.

        The structure of the table is such that alarm status is
        supported on a unit or interface basis, and then on an alarm
        type basis within the interface.  For simplicity sake and to
        support the reporting of status of all alarms, a unit is
        treated as an interface in this table."
