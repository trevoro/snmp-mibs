     --  This MIB module combines the syntax of snmp v1
     --  definition for IEEE 802.3 repeaters (RFC 1516) with
     --  the additional features defined in the snmp v2 version
     --  (RFC 2108). 
     -- 
     --  The structure of this MIB closely follows that of the
     --  definition in RFC 2108, with the relative tree structure
     --  of the variables unchanged. The following changes
     --  are salient :
     --  1)   All variables names as mentioned in RFC 2108 have been 
     --       preceded by the letter "v" to reinforce the fact that 
     --       this is vertical's private implementaion
     --  2)   All deprecated items in RFC 2108 have been removed 
     --       to provide better readability.
     --  3)   All v2 specific data types have been replaced with
     --       corresponding v1 data types. 
     --  4)   Traps have redefined to reflect v1 syntax 
     --  5)   Added vrptrGroupSlotNumber in vrptrGroupTable
     --  6)   Added vrptrPortLinkState
     --  7)   Changed the syntax of some Monitor Port items to Integer from 
     --       Counter to show values -1, (unSupported)

               The agent will always return the value noReset(1)
               when this object is read.

               After receiving a request to set this variable to
               reset(2), the agent is allowed to delay the reset
               for a short period.  For example, the implementor

               event, the SNMP response must be transmitted.

               received during the test may or may not be
               transferred.  e) The test does not interfere with
               management functions.

               After performing this self-test, the agent will
               update the repeater health information (including

               CarrierEvent on this port with ActivityDuration
               less than ShortEventMaxTime.  ShortEventMaxTime is
               greater than 74 bit times and less than 82 bit
               times.  ShortEventMaxTime has tolerances included
               to provide for circuit losses between a
               conformance test point at the AUI and the
               measurement point within the state machine.

               Notes:

               ShortEvents may indicate externally
               generated noise hits which will cause the repeater
               to transmit Runts to its other ports, or propagate
               a collision (which may be late) back to the
               transmitting DTE and damaged frames to the rest of
               the network.

               Implementors may wish to consider selecting the
               ShortEventMaxTime towards the lower end of the
               allowed tolerance range to accommodate bit losses
               suffered through physical channel devices not
               budgeted for within this standard.

               The significance of this attribute is different
               in 10 and 100 Mb/s collision domains.  Clause 9
               repeaters perform fragment extension of short
               events which would be counted as runts on the
               interconnect ports of other repeaters.  Clause
               27 repeaters do not perform fragment extension.

               this group.  If an implementation can not obtain
               a count of octets as seen by the repeater itself,
               this counter may be the summation of the
               values of the rptrMonitorPortReadableOctets
               counters for all of the ports in the group.

               This statistic provides an indicator of the total
               data transferred.  The approximate minimum time
               for rollover of this counter in a 10Mb/s repeater
               is 58 minutes divided by the number of ports in
               the repeater.

               For 100Mb/s repeaters processing traffic at a
               maximum rate, this counter can roll over in less
               than 6 minutes divided by the number of ports in
               the repeater.  Since that amount of time could
               be less than a management station's poll cycle
               time, in order to avoid a loss of information a
               management station is advised to also poll the
               rptrMonUpper32TotalOctets object, or to use the
               64-bit counter defined by rptrMonHCTotalOctets
               instead of the two 32-bit counters."
