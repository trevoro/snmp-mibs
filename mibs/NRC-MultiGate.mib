   -- All representations of MAC addresses in this MIB Module use,

   MacAddress ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE (6))    -- a 6 octet address in

   -- defined by IEEE 802.1a, i.e., as if it were transmitted least
   -- significant bit first, even though 802.5 (in contrast to other
   -- 802.x protocols) requires MAC addresses to be transmitted most
   -- significant bit first.
   --
   -- 16-bit addresses, if needed, are represented by setting their
   -- upper 4 octets to all 0's, i.e., AAFF would be represented
   -- as 00000000AAFF.


   -- Similarly, all representations of Bridge-Id in this MIB Module
   -- use, as a textual convention (i.e. this convention does not affect
   -- their encoding), the data type:

   BridgeId ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE (8))   -- the Bridge-Identifier as
                                          -- used in the Spanning Tree
   -- Protocol to uniquely identify a bridge.  Its first two octets
   -- (in network byte order) contain a priority value and its last
   -- 6 octets contain the MAC address used to refer to a bridge in a
   -- unique fashion (typically, the numerically smallest MAC address
   -- of all ports on the bridge).
   -- Several objects in this MIB module represent values of timers
   -- used by the Spanning Tree Protocol.  In this MIB, these timers
   -- have values in units of hundreths of a second (i.e. 1/100 secs).
   -- These timers, when stored in a Spanning Tree Protocol's BPDU,
   -- are in units of 1/256 seconds.  Note, however, that 802.1d/D9
   -- specifies a settable granularity of no more than 1 second for
   -- these timers.  To avoid ambiguity, a data type is defined here
   -- as a textual convention and all representation of these timers
   -- in this MIB module are defined using this data type.  An algorithm
   -- is also defined for converting between the different units, to
   -- ensure a timer's value is not distorted by multiple conversions.
   -- The data type is:

   Timeout ::= INTEGER      -- a STP timer in units of 1/100 seconds

   -- To convert a Timeout value into a value in units of
   -- 1/256 seconds, the following algorithm should be used:
   --
   --      b  = floor( (n * 256) / 100)
   --
   -- where:
   --      floor   =  quotient [ignore remainder]
   --      n is the value in 1/100 second units
   --      b is the value in 1/256 second units
   --
   -- To convert the value from 1/256 second units back to
   -- 1/100 seconds, the following algorithm should be used:
   --
   --      n = ceiling( (b * 100) / 256)
   --
   -- where:
   --      ceiling =  quotient [if remainder is 0], or
   --                 quotient + 1 [if remainder is non-zero]
   --      n is the value in 1/100 second units
   --      b is the value in 1/256 second units
   --
   -- Note: it is important that the arithmetic operations are done
   -- in the order specified (i.e., multiply first, divide second).
