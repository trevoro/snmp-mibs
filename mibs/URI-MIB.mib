Uri ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
   DISPLAY-HINT "255a"
   STATUS      current
   DESCRIPTION
            "A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) as defined by STD 66.

            This URI MUST be a normalized as defined in section 6 of
            RFC 3986 STD 66.  STD 66 defines that some parts of a URI
            are case-insensitive, but objects using this textual
            convention MUST use normalized URIs.  The purpose of this
            restriction is to help provide unique URIs for use as MIB
            table indexes.  Note that normalization of URIs does not
            by itself provide uniqueness: Two textually distinct
            normalized URIs may be equivalent."

   DESCRIPTION

            normalized URIs may be equivalent.

            STD 66 URIs are of unlimited length.  Objects using this
            textual convention impose an arbitrary length limit on the
            URIs that they can represent.  If no length restriction is
            required, then objects SHOULD use the 'Uri' textual
            convention instead."
