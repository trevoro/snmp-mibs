-- Vr/<string> Pp/<string> ClusterTbBridgePort
-- This component represents the functionality called Cluster Bridging. 
-- Cluster Bridging allows for MAC frames, carrying packets belonging a 
-- certain network protocol, to be bridged and routed at the same time. 
-- Also, it provides for a convenient way to manage the entire cluster of 
-- LANs, using a single attachment point to the cluster of LANs, the 
-- Cluster Bridge Port. To realize these features, the network protocol(s) 
-- should also be provisioned on same port as the Cluster Bridge Port. 
-- ClusterTbBridgePort represents a cluster of Tb LANs.

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute is indicative of the unique number assigned to the bridge 
      port. It is used for SNMP management of this bridge port and in 
      spanning tree as an identifier this bridge port.
      Notes regarding portNum:
      
      Escape routines exist for initializing, copying, and deleting port 
      numbers. This is necessary because SNMP requires a unique port 
      instance identifier. The initPortNum escape routine sets the port number 
      to a value in the range 1-255 for this purpose. The setCopiedPortNum 
      escape routine exists to maintain the uniqueness of the port number in 
      cases when one port is copied to another. When a bridge port is deleted, 
      the releasePortNum escape routine places the port number being 
      released into a pending deletion state. This is because the port number 
      cannot be re-allocated until the port is truely deleted in the current view. 
      This is necessary since there is no guarantee of order when processing 
      changes to multiple protocol ports so without the pending deletion state, 
      the same port number could be temporarily assigned to two ports for a 
      short period of time.
      
      The portNum is set as component critical since bridging also uses the 
      port number as a key for indexing into its data structures. If a port is 
      deleted then re-added under the same protocol port, CAS treats the 
      change as a SET to the portNum attribute."

      Notes regarding portNum:
      
      Escape routines exist for initializing, copying, and deleting port 
      numbers. This is necessary because SNMP requires a unique port 
      instance identifier. The initPortNum escape routine sets the port number 
      to a value in the range 1-255 for this purpose. The setCopiedPortNum 
      escape routine exists to maintain the uniqueness of the port number in 
      cases when one port is copied to another. When a bridge port is deleted, 
      the releasePortNum escape routine places the port number being 
      released into a pending deletion state. This is because the port number 
      cannot be re-allocated until the port is truely deleted in the current view. 
      This is necessary since there is no guarantee of order when processing 
      changes to multiple protocol ports so without the pending deletion state, 
      the same port number could be temporarily assigned to two ports for a 
      short period of time.
      
      The portNum is set as component critical since bridging also uses the 
      port number as a key for indexing into its data structures. If a port is 
      deleted then re-added under the same protocol port, CAS treats the 
      change as a SET to the portNum attribute."

     "This attribute is indicative of the unique number assigned to the bridge 
      port. It is used for SNMP management of this bridge port and in 
      spanning tree as an identifier this bridge port.
      Notes regarding portNum:
      
      Escape routines exist for initializing, copying, and deleting port 
      numbers. This is necessary because SNMP requires a unique port 
      instance identifier. The initPortNum escape routine sets the port number 
      to a value in the range 1-255 for this purpose. The setCopiedPortNum 
      escape routine exists to maintain the uniqueness of the port number in 
      cases when one port is copied to another. When a bridge port is deleted, 
      the releasePortNum escape routine places the port number being 
      released into a pending deletion state. This is because the port number 
      cannot be re-allocated until the port is truely deleted in the current view. 
      This is necessary since there is no guarantee of order when processing 
      changes to multiple protocol ports so without the pending deletion state, 
      the same port number could be temporarily assigned to two ports for a 
      short period of time.
      
      The portNum is set as component critical since bridging also uses the 
      port number as a key for indexing into its data structures. If a port is 
      deleted then re-added under the same protocol port, CAS treats the 
      change as a SET to the portNum attribute."

      Notes regarding portNum:
      
      Escape routines exist for initializing, copying, and deleting port 
      numbers. This is necessary because SNMP requires a unique port 
      instance identifier. The initPortNum escape routine sets the port number 
      to a value in the range 1-255 for this purpose. The setCopiedPortNum 
      escape routine exists to maintain the uniqueness of the port number in 
      cases when one port is copied to another. When a bridge port is deleted, 
      the releasePortNum escape routine places the port number being 
      released into a pending deletion state. This is because the port number 
      cannot be re-allocated until the port is truely deleted in the current view. 
      This is necessary since there is no guarantee of order when processing 
      changes to multiple protocol ports so without the pending deletion state, 
      the same port number could be temporarily assigned to two ports for a 
      short period of time.
      
      The portNum is set as component critical since bridging also uses the 
      port number as a key for indexing into its data structures. If a port is 
      deleted then re-added under the same protocol port, CAS treats the 
      change as a SET to the portNum attribute."

      spanning tree as an identifier this bridge port.
      Notes regarding portNum:
      
      Escape routines exist for initializing, copying, and deleting port 
      numbers. This is necessary because SNMP requires a unique port 
      instance identifier. The initPortNum escape routine sets the port number 
      to a value in the range 1-255 for this purpose. The setCopiedPortNum 
      escape routine exists to maintain the uniqueness of the port number in 
      cases when one port is copied to another. When a bridge port is deleted, 
      the releasePortNum escape routine places the port number being 
      released into a pending deletion state. This is because the port number 
      cannot be re-allocated until the port is truely deleted in the current view. 
      This is necessary since there is no guarantee of order when processing 
      changes to multiple protocol ports so without the pending deletion state, 
      the same port number could be temporarily assigned to two ports for a 
      short period of time.
      
      The portNum is set as component critical since bridging also uses the 
      port number as a key for indexing into its data structures. If a port is 
      deleted then re-added under the same protocol port, CAS treats the 
      change as a SET to the portNum attribute."

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute is indicative of the unique number assigned to the bridge 
      port. It is used for SNMP management of this bridge port and in 
      spanning tree as an identifier this bridge port.
      Notes regarding portNum:
      
      Escape routines exist for initializing, copying, and deleting port 
      numbers. This is necessary because SNMP requires a unique port 
      instance identifier. The initPortNum escape routine sets the port number 
      to a value in the range 1-255 for this purpose. The setCopiedPortNum 
      escape routine exists to maintain the uniqueness of the port number in 
      cases when one port is copied to another. When a bridge port is deleted, 
      the releasePortNum escape routine places the port number being 
      released into a pending deletion state. This is because the port number 
      cannot be re-allocated until the port is truely deleted in the current view. 
      This is necessary since there is no guarantee of order when processing 
      changes to multiple protocol ports so without the pending deletion state, 
      the same port number could be temporarily assigned to two ports for a 
      short period of time.
      
      The portNum is set as component critical since bridging also uses the 
      port number as a key for indexing into its data structures. If a port is 
      deleted then re-added under the same protocol port, CAS treats the 
      change as a SET to the portNum attribute."

      Notes regarding portNum:
      
      Escape routines exist for initializing, copying, and deleting port 
      numbers. This is necessary because SNMP requires a unique port 
      instance identifier. The initPortNum escape routine sets the port number 
      to a value in the range 1-255 for this purpose. The setCopiedPortNum 
      escape routine exists to maintain the uniqueness of the port number in 
      cases when one port is copied to another. When a bridge port is deleted, 
      the releasePortNum escape routine places the port number being 
      released into a pending deletion state. This is because the port number 
      cannot be re-allocated until the port is truely deleted in the current view. 
      This is necessary since there is no guarantee of order when processing 
      changes to multiple protocol ports so without the pending deletion state, 
      the same port number could be temporarily assigned to two ports for a 
      short period of time.
      
      The portNum is set as component critical since bridging also uses the 
      port number as a key for indexing into its data structures. If a port is 
      deleted then re-added under the same protocol port, CAS treats the 
      change as a SET to the portNum attribute."

-- Vr/<string> Pp/<string> SrsgBridgePort
-- This component represents a controlled method to allow exchange of 
-- explorer frames between source route (SR) and source route transparent 
-- (SRT) networks.The SrsgBridgePort provides a cross over point for 
-- explorer frames from the source route network into the source route 
-- gating logic and vice-versa. The source route gating performs required 
-- verification before forwarding the frames into the source route 
-- transparent network.
-- The SrsgBridgePort participates in the source route spanning tree to 
-- eliminate possible loops caused by multiple active cross over points on 
-- multiple bridges and to provide for fault tolerance of these cross over 
-- points. While enabled, source route spanning tree BPDUs are sent 
-- across the source route transparent network, through this cross over 
-- point and the gating logic. Note that these explorer frames cross over 
-- based on the port's stpPortState.
-- All route explorer frames (ARE) are exchanged regardless of the 
-- stpPortState. 
-- Spanning tree explorer frames (STE) are exchanged only if stpPortState 
-- has a value of Forwarding.
-- If stpPortState has a value of Blocking STE frames will be sent out on 
-- bridge ports that are operating in the same mode, i.e. no exchange across 
-- SR and SRT networks takes place. Nevertheless, SR spanning tree 
-- BPDUs are still sent across the SRT network. Note that the 
-- SrsgBridgePort and the TbsgBridgePort must be provisioned during the 
-- same provisioning session as one cannot function without the other.

      Notes regarding portNum:
      
      Escape routines exist for initializing, copying, and deleting port 
      numbers. This is necessary because SNMP requires a unique port 
      instance identifier. The initPortNum escape routine sets the port number 
      to a value in the range 1-255 for this purpose. The setCopiedPortNum 
      escape routine exists to maintain the uniqueness of the port number in 
      cases when one port is copied to another. When a bridge port is deleted, 
      the releasePortNum escape routine places the port number being 
      released into a pending deletion state. This is because the port number 
      cannot be re-allocated until the port is truely deleted in the current view. 
      This is necessary since there is no guarantee of order when processing 
      changes to multiple protocol ports so without the pending deletion state, 
      the same port number could be temporarily assigned to two ports for a 
      short period of time.
      
      The portNum is set as component critical since bridging also uses the 
      port number as a key for indexing into its data structures. If a port is 
      deleted then re-added under the same protocol port, CAS treats the 
      change as a SET to the portNum attribute."

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute specifies if the domain information should be preserved or 
      embedded in the frame header. This attribute applies only to backbone 
      ports and does not affect the access bridge ports. By setting this attribute 
      to a value of on, domain information could be preserved in frames being 
      tunnelled across the a backbone, so that this information can be 
      deciphered at the other end of the backbone tunnel. This preserves the 
      integrity of the domains thus preventing domain breaches while 
      tunnelling frames across backbone network. 
      If the value of this attribute is set to off then domain information is not 
      preserved in the header of the frames tunnelling through the backbone. 
      This eliminates the overhead incurred to preserve domain information 
      across the backbone while tunnelling frames across it.
      Preserve domain is relevant when used in conjunction with the following 
      media: FDDI, ATM MPE, Frame Relay and PPP. It is ignored when 
      used with other types of media."

     "This attribute is indicative of the unique number assigned to the bridge 
      port. It is used for SNMP management of this bridge port and in 
      spanning tree as an identifier this bridge port.
      Notes regarding portNum:
      
      Escape routines exist for initializing, copying, and deleting port 
      numbers. This is necessary because SNMP requires a unique port 
      instance identifier. The initPortNum escape routine sets the port number 
      to a value in the range 1-255 for this purpose. The setCopiedPortNum 
      escape routine exists to maintain the uniqueness of the port number in 
      cases when one port is copied to another. When a bridge port is deleted, 
      the releasePortNum escape routine places the port number being 
      released into a pending deletion state. This is because the port number 
      cannot be re-allocated until the port is truely deleted in the current view. 
      This is necessary since there is no guarantee of order when processing 
      changes to multiple protocol ports so without the pending deletion state, 
      the same port number could be temporarily assigned to two ports for a 
      short period of time.
      
      The portNum is set as component critical since bridging also uses the 
      port number as a key for indexing into its data structures. If a port is 
      deleted then re-added under the same protocol port, CAS treats the 
      change as a SET to the portNum attribute."

      Notes regarding portNum:
      
      Escape routines exist for initializing, copying, and deleting port 
      numbers. This is necessary because SNMP requires a unique port 
      instance identifier. The initPortNum escape routine sets the port number 
      to a value in the range 1-255 for this purpose. The setCopiedPortNum 
      escape routine exists to maintain the uniqueness of the port number in 
      cases when one port is copied to another. When a bridge port is deleted, 
      the releasePortNum escape routine places the port number being 
      released into a pending deletion state. This is because the port number 
      cannot be re-allocated until the port is truely deleted in the current view. 
      This is necessary since there is no guarantee of order when processing 
      changes to multiple protocol ports so without the pending deletion state, 
      the same port number could be temporarily assigned to two ports for a 
      short period of time.
      
      The portNum is set as component critical since bridging also uses the 
      port number as a key for indexing into its data structures. If a port is 
      deleted then re-added under the same protocol port, CAS treats the 
      change as a SET to the portNum attribute."
