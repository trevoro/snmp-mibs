   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute specifies handling of channel maintenance events 
      such as locking and unlocking a channel or channel registration on

      RESTART messages, SERVICE messages, or nothing. Note that 
      channel registration only occurs after the global interface restart at 
      startup.
      
      The attribute controls start-up handling absolutely, and channel lock 
      and unlock conditionally. That is, setting this to enable SERVICE 
      messages ensures SERVICE messages at start-up and whenever a 
      channel goes into or out of service. However, if this is not set to 
      enable SERVICE messaging, a RESTART is always sent on 
      unlocking a channel. 
      
      globalOnStartup provides the minimum required function at start-
      up, without any individual channel confirmation. Note that when 
      this is set, channel RESTART is still used for channel unlock. 
      globalOnStartup applies to SigChan start-up only.
      
      serviceMessage enables sending and receiving SERVICE messages. 
      If enabled, SERVICE messages are always used for channel 
      maintenance on channel lock, channel unlock and start-up.
      
      restartMessage provides individual channel RESTARTs when a 
      SigChan starts up. If enabled, the RESTART is used at start-up and 
      channel unlock. However, if both SERVICE and RESTART 
      messages are disabled, the RESTART will still be used when a

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute defines which types of tracing are active for this 
      signalling channel.  The tracing messages are sent to the debug 
      stream. To see the messages the agentQueue attribute in Col/debug 
      must be greater than 0 and a Telnet NMIS session must list the 
      debug stream in in its data streams (ex. set nmis telnet session/1 
      dataStreams debug). Different types of tracing can be enabled 
      simultaneously.  
      Note that tracing consumes additional CPU resources and will slow 
      down call processing on a heavily loaded card.  If there is message 
      block exhaustion tracing will be suspended for a period and then 
      automatically reenabled.  An alarm is generated on tracing 
      suspension and resumption.  This mechanism protects the function 
      processor against excessive numbers of tracing messages.
      
      Types of tracing include: 
      protocolErrors - get details of any protocol errors which are 
      occuring. Protocol errors are also reported in summary form as 
      alarms. 
      q931Summary - Summary of the Q.931 messages on the signalling 
      link, including certain call details (calling number, called number, 
      release codes). 
      q931Hex - Q.931 messages displayed in hex format.  Useful to 
      determine protocol compliance in case of errors reported on local or 
      remote ends.
      q931Symbolic - Q.931 messages parsed to give maximum detail.  
      Useful for understanding content of messages flowing on the link.

      link.

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute specifies the features to be supported by MCDN 
      'TCAP' connectionless messaging. Note that some features such as 
      Network ACD combine connectionless and connection oriented. In 
      the NACD case, the connectionless messaging enables the source 
      and target PBXs to establish the networked relationship, and calls 
      sent across the network (connection oriented) will contain basic 
      information relating the call to the feature.
      
      Feature Definitions:
      networkAcd: transfer of a call from a pool of agents to a second 
      pool of agents across the network.
      networkMessageService: message waiting capability (for example, 
      lamps on sets). Also includes signalling for voice mail, but is not 
      limited to voice mail.
      networkVoiceMail: a specific subset of Network Message Service, 
      separated functionally as it always terminates on an interactive 
      voice response mailbox application.
      networkRingAgain: ring again to remote sets.
      electronicLock: change of set capabilities by a remote user dialling 
      the applicable code and password.
      remoteCallForward: call forwarding a phone via applicable code 
      and password.
      callPickupNetworkWide (call pickup world wide): scan for a 
      ringing call on another node, to enable the scanning set to pick up 
      the call.
      networkPackage1: a collection of other features including but not 
      limited to network clock synchronization. Note that on the Meridian 
      1, this is a general purpose group used for very small features not 
      requiring a new ISDN Facility feature type.
      isdnApplicationInterface: network wide support of a number of 
      Meridian 1 Application Module Link features.
      mobilityMultisiteNetworking: the capability to use a wireless phone 
      in multiple sites, by having the phone register on arrival at the new 
      site, and having the PBX at the new site negotiate the set 
      'relocation' with the base PBX.
      miscellaneous: Any feature that is not listed above.

      ('operator') services.
      classOfServiceTransport: this is not a ROSE feature. Class of 
      Service transport takes place in the called party number when 
      provisioned on the Meridian 1 to use an ESN signalling type.
      trunkRouteOptimization: dropping of redundant links in a call, 
      when a set call forwards a call prior to answer.
      remoteVirtualQueuing: queuing at a remote node without requiring 
      a B channel to be kept up.
      offHookQueuing: Queuing by maintaining the speech path to the 
      queuing node.
      networkCallTrace: call progress tracing across a network (that is, 
      call reached node a, node b, terminated at c,...).
      networkIntercom: network wide access to an intercom system onm 
      a Meridian 1.
      callPickupNetworkWide: connection oriented messages associated 
      with the TCAP call pickup scan operation. The messages that 
      actually pick up the ringing call.
      radioPaging: access to a radio paging system network wide, 
      allowing single radio paging facilities in a relatively dense local 
      PBX network.
      networkAccess: information to enable access to PBX features from 
      outside the network. Additional data is provided to identify access 
      capabilities for a spoecific call. (Similar to transmittiong 
      authorization code capabilities network wide.)
      antiTromboning: actually includes two capabilities - NAS 
      (Network Attendant Setvice) and Trunk Anti-Tromboning. Calls 
      that exit the subnet to a PBX and are transferred back to a network 
      number via the same D channel can be optimized. If PBX A 
      (Passport A) calls across the subnet to Passport B, D channel Z, to 
      PBX B, and PBX B transfers across D channel Z to Passport B and 
      therefore to PBX C/Passport C, this allows tha call to simplify to 
      PBX/Passport A to PBX/Passport C.
