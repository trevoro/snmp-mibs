   DESCRIPTION
"Determines the protocol (configuration method) for the console port.

The setting of this object is dynamic. The console port immediately 
implements the option you enter. However, if you change the protocol you are 
currently using to configure the port your connection will be lost.

Options:
localConsole (1): you use this protocol when you attach a TTY terminal 
directly to the console port. This protocol requires you to use command line 
configuration. You also must enter a password to gain access to the 
configuration tables. You can define the password using the object 
uiPassword of the CXUserInterface Table.

ppp (2): you use this protocol when you are configuring via a windows-based 
application such as HP/OV (Hewlett Packard-OpenView).

Default Value: ppp (2)

Configuration Changed: operative"
