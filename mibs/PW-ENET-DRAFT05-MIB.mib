          - 'other' indicate operation that is not defined by 
            this MIB module. 
   
          - 'portBased' indicates that the forwarder will forward 
            packets between the port and the PW independent of their 
            structure (i.e. there is no service delimiting VLAN tags 
            from the PE standpoint).  
   
          - 'noChange' indicates that the PW contains the original 
             user VLAN, as specified in pwVcEnetPortVlan, i.e. the 
             VLAN on the PE-CE link is the service delimiting tag 
             and is kept as is on the PW. This is allowed only for 
             pwVcType equal 'ethernetTagged'.  
   
          - 'changeVlan' indicates that the VLAN field on the PW 
            may be different than the VLAN field on the user's  
            port. the VLAN on the PE-CE link is the service delimiting 
            tag but has a different value on the PW. 
   
          - 'removeVlan' indicates that the encapsulation on the  
            PW does not include the service delimiting VLAN field.  
            Note that PRI bits transparency is lost in this case. 
   
          - 'addVlan' indicate that a VLAN field will be added 
            on the PSN bound direction. pwVcEnetPwVlan indicates 
            the value that will be added.  
   
          - Implementation of 'portsbased', 'removeVlan', 'addVlan'  
            'other' and 'changeVlan' is OPTIONAL.

          The value of '4097' NUST be used if the whole port traffic
