    DESCRIPTION
         "The maximum waiting delay (Tdmax) timeout value used by the
         Media Gateway to send the Restart In Progress with the restart
         method as RM:disconnected to the Media Gateway Controller when
         the endpoint has become disconnected is defined by this object.

         The endpoint becomes disconnected when it tries to communicate
         with the call agent and the retransmission procedure times out
         after retrying.

         The endpoint in disconnected state starts the disconnected timer
         initialised to the random value and uniformly distributed between
         1 and initial waiting delay (Tdinit) in seconds. 

         The gateway waits for either the end of this timer, or the reception
         of call agent command or the detection of local user activity for 
         the endpoint.

         When the disconnected timer elapses, or when a command is received
         from the call agent or when there is a local user activity, the 
         Media Gateway sends the Restart In Progress command with the restart 
         method as RM:disconnected to the Media Gateway Controller.

         If the disconnected procedure still left the endpoint disconnected,
         the disconnected timer is doubled subject to a provisionable
         disconnected maximum waiting delay (Tdmax) in seconds and the
         gateway starts the new disconnected procedure again.

         Once the maximum value is reached, the subsequent disconnected
         Restart In Progress commands use the maximum waiting delay (Tdmax).
         
         The recommended value of this object is 600 seconds.
