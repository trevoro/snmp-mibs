-- FrameRelayAtmInterface/n
-- This component defines an instance of the Frame Relay to ATM 
-- interworking interface. It manages the set of Frame Relay DLCI 
-- connections that are interworked with ATM connections. The 
-- component instance value is a unique positive integer within a 
-- module. Framer is created whenever the FrAtm is added. Users who 
-- need VirtualFramer should delete the Framer first, then add the 
-- VirtualFramer.

      otherwise the component inherits the CID of its parent. The top-
      level component has a CID of 0.
      
      Every operator session also has a CID, which is the CID 
      provisioned for the operator's user ID. An operator will see only the 
      stream data for components having a matching CID. Also, the 
      operator will be allowed to issue commands for only those 
      components which have a matching CID.
      
      An operator CID of 0 is used to identify the Network Manager 
      (referred to as 'NetMan' in DPN). This CID matches the CID of 
      any component. Values 1 to 8191 inclusive (equivalent to 'basic 
      CIDs' in DPN) may be assigned to specific customers."

     "If supported by the component, this attribute indicates the OSI

      defined as a multi-valued set, at most one value is shown to the user.
      
      When no values are in the set, this indicates that either the attribute 
      is not supported or that none of the status conditions described 
      below are present.
      
      The value inTest indicates that the resource is undergoing a test 
      procedure. If adminState is locked or shuttingDown, the normal 
      users are precluded from using the resource and controlStatus is 
      reservedForTest. Tests that do not exclude additional users can be 
      present in any operational or administrative state but the 
      reservedForTest condition should not be present.
      
      The value failed indicates that the component has an internal fault 
      that prevents it from operating. The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value dependency indicates that the component cannot operate 
      because some other resource on which it depends is unavailable. 
      The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value powerOff indicates the resource requires power to be 
      applied and it is not powered on. The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value offLine indicates the resource requires a routine 
      operation (either manual, automatic, or both) to be performed to 
      place it on-line and make it available for use. The operationalState 
      is disabled.
      
      The value offDuty indicates the resource is inactive in accordance 
      with a predetermined time schedule. In the absence of other 
      disabling conditions, the operationalState is enabled or disabled.
      
      The value degraded indicates the service provided by the 
      component is degraded in some way, such as in speed or operating 
      capacity. However, the resource remains available for service. The 
      operationalState is enabled.

      The value initializationRequired indicates (for a resource which 
      doesn't initialize autonomously) that initialization is required before 
      it can perform its normal functions, and this procedure has not been 
      initiated. The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value notInitialized indicates (for a resource which does

      initiated. The operationalState may be enabled or disabled.

      The value partOfServicesLocked indicates that part of the service is

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute specifies the traffic parameter conversion policy to use 
      for a specific transfer priority for specifying equivalent bandwidth 
      rate at the FrAtm interface. 
      
      Policy 3 characterizes the traffic in the following way:
      - ATM traffic descriptor type 6 is selected
      - ATM service category rtVbr and nrtVbr supported only
      - PCR0+1 is based on AR
      - SCR0+1 is based on CIR and EIR
      - MBS0+1 is based on Bc, Be, CIR, EIR and AR
      - Takes into account that the instantaneous rate of the Frame Relay 
      stream can be above CIR and up to the AR.
      
      Policy 4 characterizes the traffic in the following way:
      - ATM traffic descriptor type 7 or 8 is selected. Type 7 is chosen 
      when non-conforming cells are to be discarded and type 8 when 
      non-conforming cells are tagged by the UPC traffic policer.
      - PCR0+1 is based on AR
      - ATM service category rtVbr and nrtVbr supported only
      - SCR0 is based on CIR
      - MBS0 is based on Bc, CIR, and AR
      - There is no direct characterization of EIR. The allowed EIR can be 
      derived using the difference between the AR and CIR.
      
      Policy 5 characterizes the traffic in the following way:
      - ATM traffic descriptor type 7 or 8 is selected. Type 7 is chosen 
      when non-conforming cells are to be discarded and type 8 when 
      non-conforming cells are tagged by the UPC traffic policer.
      - ATM service category rtVbr and nrtVbr supported only
      - PCR0+1 is based on CIR for descriptor type 7
      - PCR0+1 is based on CIR and EIR for descriptor type 8
      - SCR0 is based on CIR
      - MBS0 is based on Bc, CIR, and AR
      - The maximum PCR is no longer based on the AR but rather on the 
      CIR and EIR or CIR
      
      Policy 6 characterizes the traffic in the following way:
      - ATM traffic descriptor type 3 is selected
      - ATM service category ubr, cbr, rtVbr and nrtVbr supported only
      - PCR0+1 is based only on CIR.
