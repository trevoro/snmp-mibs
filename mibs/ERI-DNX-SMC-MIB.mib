             that sets the trap as active and a corresponding code that 
             clears the trap to simulate an alarm.  The event type codes
             are have the prefix 'evnt' but also occur at the start of 
             and end of the event.  Each Type code has base number that
             represents the resource type followed by the bit number from
             the resource extended device state. Each event or alarm will
             have a trap for the start equal to the bit number plus the base
             number and then a trap at the end of the event/alarm equal to
             the bit number plus the base number plus 40.  
             For example, clearSlotMissing(142) represents a SLOT resource 
             which has a base 100, bit 2 for slot missing, plus 40 to signify
             the end of the alarm.  The exception to this is General Events
