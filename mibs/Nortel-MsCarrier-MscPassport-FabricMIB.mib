-- Shelf Card/n FabricPort/f
-- This component represents a physical fabric port on a card. A fabric 
-- port is a card's interface to a fabric card; it provides a pathway for 
-- the card to send cells over the fabric card to the other cards in the 
-- module, and to receive cells sent to it over the fabric card by the 
-- other cards in the module.
-- 
-- A card's FabricPort components are created automatically 
-- whenever the card begins acting as an active or standby LP. They 
-- remain in existence as long as the card remains operational. 
-- FabricPort components cannot be added or deleted.

      When no values are in the set, this indicates that either the attribute 
      is not supported or that none of the status conditions described 
      below are present.
      
      The value inTest indicates that the resource is undergoing a test 
      procedure. If adminState is locked or shuttingDown, the normal 
      users are precluded from using the resource and controlStatus is 
      reservedForTest. Tests that do not exclude additional users can be 
      present in any operational or administrative state but the

      The value dependency indicates that the component cannot operate 
      because some other resource on which it depends is unavailable.

      place it on-line and make it available for use. The operationalState 
      is disabled.

      with a predetermined time schedule. In the absence of other 
      disabling conditions, the operationalState is enabled or disabled.
      
      The value degraded indicates the service provided by the

      capacity. However, the resource remains available for service. The

      The value initializationRequired indicates (for a resource which 
      doesn't initialize autonomously) that initialization is required before 
      it can perform its normal functions, and this procedure has not been 
      initiated. The operationalState is disabled.

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute indicates the slot numbers of the cards that the fabric 
      port considers available through the fabric; that is, the cards that 
      have an operational port connected to the fabric. The value of this 
      attribute is determined automatically by the fabric port by 
      monitoring signals generated by each fabric port connected to the 
      fabric card. Normally, every card in the module signals its 
      availability on both fabrics. If a card does not signal its availability 
      on a fabric, then the card is not present or its fabric port has failed. 
      By examining this attribute for both of a card's FabricPort 
      components, it is possible to determine which cards are present in 
      the module and which fabric each can use.
      
      Note: If failuresInEffect has a value of selfTest, signalLoss, 
      synchronizationLoss, or protocolError, the fabric port is unable to 
      monitor the availability of the fabric ports on the fabric. In such 
      cases, cardsAvailable indicates that no fabric port is available on the 
      fabric.

-- Shelf FabricCard/b Test
-- This component is used to verify the operation of a fabric card. A 
-- fabric card test may be run as part of a regular maintenance 
-- program, or to diagnose the cause of a fabric-related problem. The 
-- Test component is created automatically, and cannot be added or 
-- deleted.
-- 
-- The fabric card test ensures that the fabric ports on a specific fabric 
-- card are functioning properly at minimal utilization rates. The fabric 
-- card to be tested must be locked while testing is in progress. The 
-- test only involves fabric ports on operational cards (active and 
-- standby LPs). If an operational card becomes non-operational or 
-- fails to respond during the test, it is dropped from the test and is not 
-- allowed to rejoin; however, the results of any tests on its fabric port 
-- up to that point are preserved. The results of the test can help to 
-- determine which portions of the fabric card system are faulty, if any.
-- 
-- A fabric card test comprises several different tests. The tests are 
-- performed in the following order:
-- self test: The fabric card performs its self-test.
-- port test: The fabric port 
-- broadcast test: Each fabric port ensures that it can receive a 
-- broadcast frame over the fabric card from every operational card 
-- (including itself).
-- ping test: Each fabric port ensures that it can receive a low priority 
-- non-broadcast frame over the backplane from every operational 
-- card (including itself).
-- 
-- Once all of the tests have been performed, the ping test is repeated 
-- continuously until the fabric card test is terminated; this repetition 
-- helps to detect transient fabric faults. The fabric test stops 
-- automatically after a specified time interval, or if it detects a self-
-- test failure, a port test failure, or a broadcast test failure.

      The value inTest indicates that the resource is undergoing a test 
      procedure. If adminState is locked or shuttingDown, the normal 
      users are precluded from using the resource and controlStatus is 
      reservedForTest. Tests that do not exclude additional users can be
