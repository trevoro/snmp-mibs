LINKSWITCH-MIB DEFINITIONS ::= BEGIN

-- This file describes the MIB supported by the
-- 3Com FMS and MSH LinkSwitch version 1.0.
--
-- revision history:
-- 05/23/94 Created.
-- 08/19/94 Add media sense and backup power supply ojbects.
-- 08/22/94 Add lsfddiPATHRingLatency object.
--
-- The LinkSwitch supports the standard "transmissions" MIB for FDDI and
-- IEEE 802.3 interfaces, the proposed standard "dot3" MIB for the
-- Ethernet interfaces, and the standard SMT/FDDI MIB for FDDI.

-- When an object's DESCRIPTION field includes the keyword DURABLE,
-- the object's value is retained across system reinitialization.
-- This MIB module uses the extended OBJECT-TYPE macro.
