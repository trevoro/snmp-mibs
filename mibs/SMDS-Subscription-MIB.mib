               -- "1110" when representing a group address

               -- This MIB is divided into six MIB modules:  SMDS Subscription
               -- Parameters and Violations Group, SMDS Address Table Group, Address Screening
               -- Group, Group Addressing Information Group, Service Disagreements Group,
               -- and Exchange Access Component of Inter-exchange SMDS Group.

               -- The SMDS Subscription Parameter and Violations Group contains the SNI's
               -- service related information (e.g., Access Class and Maximum Concurrent Data Units







               -- In and Out) along with counts of SIP L3_PDUs that were discarded because of
               -- a service violation (e.g., exceeded the subscribed to access class).

               -- The SMDS Address Table Group contains the mapping between SMDS Addresses
               -- and the ifIndex for an SNI.  An SNI may have up to 16 addresses assigned to it.

               -- The Address Screening Group is a collection of six tables.  These six tables
               -- are used to identify up to 4 Individual Address Screens and up to 4 Group
               -- Address Screens.  Two tables are used to identify all the screens (i.e., there
               -- may be up to 8 screens) and the default screens for each SNI.  New screens can
               -- be created and deleted by using these tables.  The default screens may be
               -- changed also.  The Associated
               -- Addresses Group is used to associate the addresses assigned to the SNI to a particular
               -- individual address screen and a particular group address screen.
               -- This information is read/writable. The Screened
               -- Addresses Group identifies the addresses to be screened (i.e., whether you want
               -- to receive SIP L3_PDUs from or send them to a particular address) within the Individual
               -- Address Screens (up to 4) and the Group Address Screens (up to 4).  This information
               -- is read/writable.

               -- The Group Addressing Information Group is a collection of 5 tables.  The
               -- Group Address Group identifies the group address and the individual addresses
               -- that are identified by the group address, and this group also
               -- provides the number of individual addresses
               -- that are associated with the group address.  New individual addresses can be identified
               -- by the group address by adding it to this table, and addresses can also be deleted
               -- from this table.  Only the owner of the group address has read/write access on this
               -- information.  Members of the group address have only read access.
               -- New group addresses can not be created by using this table, new group
               -- addresses can only be assigned by the service provider.
               -- The Member Group Address Group identifies
               -- the individual address and all of the group addresses with which it is associated.
               -- Using this table, the group addresses can only be disassociated from the individual
               -- addresses; meaning that the group member may only delete the row and not create a new row
               -- in this table.  This capability is under study.
               -- Allowing the group member to disassociate their individual address from
               -- This group also provides the number of group addresses an individual address belongs and
               -- the number of group addresses that are assigned to each SNI.

               -- The Service Disagreement Group provides the latest occurrences of SIP L3_PDUs
               -- that were discarded because of particular service violations.  This information is provided
               -- in a log format.

               -- The Exchange Access Component of Inter-exchange SMDS Group is divided into
               -- three groups; the Exchange Access SMDS Subscription Parameters and Violations







               -- Group, the Carrier Blocking Group, and the Carrier Index Group.  The Exchange
               -- Access SMDS Subscription Parameters and Violations Group provides subscription
               -- parameter information (e.g., the Carrier selected to provide Exchange Access SMDS for this
               -- SNI) and counts of violations.  The Carrier Blocking Group provides information on the carriers
               -- that are blocking an SNI and the number of packets that were discarded per carrier.  The
               -- Carrier Index Group associates the carrier's interface(s) to the SMDS network as one
               -- interface and assigns an ifIndex to it.

                      "This object provides hints on how an SMDS Address
                      is divided into three fields.  These three fields
                      are used as indices into tables that need to be
                      indexed by an SMDS address.  These three fields
                      provide for a user-friendly/readable format in
                      order to do SETs and GETs.  The three fields are
                      country code, destination code, and subscriber
                      number.  Each field MUST only contain 1 to 9
                      digits and must NOT start with a zero.  All SMDS
                      addresses will have a country code.  Most SMDS
                      addresses will have a destination code (e.g., in
                      the US this number is the area code).  The
                      subscriber number is the rest of the SMDS address,
                      which is less than or equal to the remaining 9
                      digits.  For those SMDS addresses that do not have
                      a destination code or whose subscriber number is
                      more than 9 digits long, the destination code and
                      the subscriber number must be divided in a logical
                      way. Also, if a field starts with zero(s), then
                      these zero(s) must be the trailing zero(s) of the
                      previous field.  It is up to the service provider
                      to determine this logic.  This object describes
                      the way that the SMDS addresses are divided for
                      this SNI (ifIndex).  For example, in the US, this
                      object will contain the following text:  'Country
                      code = 1. Destination code = area code (e.g.,

                      (e.g., 7582107). The OID looks like

                      a value between 1 and s).

                      This list identifies the s screens associated with
                      an SNI accompanied by an indication (screenStatus)
                      of whether the screening comprises 'allowed

                      (associatedScreenGrpIndex).

                      destination address screening at the network

                      when the associated SNI address is an Individual
                      Address.  2) defGAScreenForIAs; the default Group
                      Address Screen used for destination address
                      screening at the network ingress of group
                      addressed L3_PDUs.  The associated SNI address
                      will always be an Individual Address (i.e., it is
                      the Source Address).  3) defIAScreenForGAs; the
                      default Individual Address Screen used for source
                      address screening at the network egress of
                      individually addressed L3_PDUs when the associated
                      SNI address is a Group Address (i.e., it is the
                      Destination Address).

                      In the future a value of n up to 2048 may be
                      supported.

                      The individual address screen (iAScreeningAddress

                      the network ingress) and Source Address Screening
