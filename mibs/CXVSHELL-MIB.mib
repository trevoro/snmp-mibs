slot number 1, voice card 2 is always associated with slot number 2 and
so on."

		DESCRIPTION

"Displays whether a voice I/O card-to-slot number association has been 
successful at the VCE layer.

Options:
recorded-in-config (1): configuration is correct but has not yet been 
implemeted. System reset required.

failed (2): configuration not performed correctly. The configuration may 
have the correct syntax but the change cannot be implemented at the VCE 
layer because there is no voice I/O card in the requested slot. If the 
requested slot is currently occupied by another kind of I/O card, for 
example an Ethernet card, the same result will occur.

connected (3): configuration performed properly and association made.

Options:
invalid (1): row is flagged; after the next reset the values will be 
disabled and the row will be deleted from the table.

valid (2): values are enabled.
