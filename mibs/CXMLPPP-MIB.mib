           "Determines whether the Magic Number is enabled or disabled.

The Magic Number is a unique random system generated number, present in 
every Configure-Request packet. The Magic Number is used to ensure that 
the same packet is not sent back and forth between the local and the 
remote in an endless loop.

If the Magic Number is enabled, then the local end of the link will check 
the Magic Number in each Configure-Request packet it receives. If the 
number is the same as its own, it will change its number and send a 
NoAcknowledge packet back to the remote. If the local end of the link 
continues to receive Configure-Requests with its own number, it assumes a 
loopback. After the number of Configure-Requests specified in 
mlpppUSapLcMaxConfigure of this table has been exceeded, the link will go 
down.

Magic Number must be disabled when Multilink is used.
