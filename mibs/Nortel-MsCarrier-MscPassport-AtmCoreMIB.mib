      ATM service category component of the AtmIf CA.
      
      This attribute applies only for unshaped VCC and VPC 
      connections. This attribute defines the transmit queueing method for 
      all unshaped connections under this AtmIf. Per-VC queueing means 
      that unshaped connections are treated with the same fairness as 
      shaped queues in the transmit round-robin scheduling. The 
      alternative to per-VC queueing is to use the common queue for a 
      particular service category (medium or low priority). The common 
      queue is only counted as one queue in the transmit round-robin 
      scheduling. Thus, if there are multiple connections which are 
      destined for the common queue, they are not fairly allocated a 
      portion of the transmit bandwidth compared to shaped connections. 
      
      When this attribute is set to perVc, any unshaped connection is 
      allocated its own per-VC queue, and is treated with the same 
      fairness as any shaped connections. Per-VC queues have a 
      maximum rate of 58,962 cell/s (25 Mbit/s) in a multi-port shaping 
      configuration. Per-VC queues also have their own congestion 
      control level. This means that total number of cell/frame blocks 
      allocated for several per-VC queues are higher than would be 
      allowed on the common queue. This can be an advantage in 
      reducing cell loss due to queue congestion. This attribute may only 
      be set to perVc if the interface supports per-VC queueing, (specified 
      by the perVcQueueInterfaces attribute in the AtmResourceControl 
      component).
      
      When this attribute is set to common, any unshaped connection is 
      destined for the common queue. The common queue has one set of 
      congestion control levels for all cells enqueued on it. The common 
      queue is only allocated one queue position when scheduling which 
      queue to transmit from. Due to the possibility of unfairness, this 
      value is only recommended in cases where the configuration cannot 
      otherwise achieve full link utilization. 
      
      When this attribute is set to autoConfigure and the interface 
      support per-VC queueing (specified by the perVcQueueInterfaces 
      attribute in the AtmResourceControl component) per-VC queueing 
      is enabled for all unshaped connections. Otherwise, the common 
      queue is used. The unshapedTransmitQueueingOper attribute

     "This attribute is only valid for AtmIf's on ATM IP FPs. It is not

      This attribute indicates the transmit cell memory size and three 
      discard thresholds for this AtmIf. Transmit cell memory is used for 
      storing ATM cells to be transmitted by connections under this 
      AtmIf. 
      
      The first value indicates the the total transmit cell memory size. 
      This is derived based upon the txCellMemoryThreshold 0 attribute 
      of the Lp/x eng arc aqm/0 component and Lp/x eng arc aqm/0 Ov, 
      and on the txCellMemory attribute of this AtmIf. 
      
      When the txCellMemoryAvailable attribute decreases to the second 
      value, the txCellMemoryCongestionState changes from 3 to 2. In 
      congestion state 2, traffic with discard priority (DP) > 2 is 
      discarded. This threshold is set approximately at 25 percent of the 
      first value, the transmit cell memory size. 
      
      When the txCellMemoryAvailable attribute decreases to the third 
      value, the txCellMemoryCongestionState changes from 2 to 1. In 
      congestion state 1, traffic with discard priority (DP) > 1 is 
      discarded. This threshold is set approximately at 20 percent of the 
      first value, the transmit cell memory size. 
      
      When the txCellMemoryAvailable attribute decreases to the fourth 
      value, the txCellMemoryCongestionState changes from 1 to 0. In 
      congestion state 0, traffic with discard priority (DP) > 0 is 
      discarded. This threshold is set approximately at 10 percent of the 
      first value, the transmit cell memory size. 
      
      The opposite effect occurs when the txCellMemoryAvailable 
      attribute increases (txCellMemoryCongestionState changes from 0 
      to 3 accordingly)."

     "This group is obsolete. Please refer to the Override component 
      below for the current provisioning group
      
      This group contains provisionable attributes which specify the VCC 
      space to be supported by an ATM interface. The VCC space 
      consists of an optional 'VPI Zero VCC Space' and an optional 
      'Programmable VCC Space'.
      
      The VPI Zero VCC Space is used to support VCCs with a VPI of 
      zero. The VCI values supported in this space range from 0 to a 
      provisioned maximum. The size of the VPI Zero VCC Space must 
      either be 0 or a multiple of 256. A value of 0 implies that no 
      programmable VCCs can be used. In this case 
      atmNumberOfNonZeroVpisForVccs_m must also be 0.
      
      The optional Programmable VCC Space is used to support VCCs 
      with a VPI other than zero. The VPI values supported in this space 
      must lie in a single contiguous range which excludes VPI 0. The 
      VCI values supported in this space range from 0 to a provisioned 
      maximum. The size of the Programmable VCC Space (should it 
      exist) must adhere to the following rules:
      
      If (firstNonZeroVpiForVccs = 1) THEN
      (numNonZeroVpisForVccs + 1) *
      numVccsPerNonZeroVpi must be a multiple of 256
      OTHERWISE
      numNonZeroVpisForVccs * numVccsPerNonZeroVpi
      must be a multiple of 256
      
      If the AtmIf is linked to a LogicalProcessor with a cardType of 
      3pE3Atm, 3pDS3Atm, 3pOC3MmAtm, 3pOC3SmAtm, 3pE1Atm, 
      3pDS1Atm or 2pJ6MAtm, the size of the entire VCC space (both 
      mandatory and optional parts) and VPC space must not exceed the 
      capacity of the port to which the interface is linked, which is 
      defined in the Arc component's totalConnectionPoolCapacity or 
      connectionPoolCapacity attribute (whichever is non-zero). When 
      using the totalConnectionPoolCapacity attribute, the capacity of the 
      port is (totalConnectionPoolCapacity divided by the number of 
      physical ports). The number of connection identifiers in the VCC 
      and VPC space can be determined as follows:
      
      IF (numNonZeroVpisForVccs = 0) THEN
      number of connection ids = 256 + numVccsForVpiZero
      OTHERWISE IF (firstNonZeroVpiForVccs = 1) THEN

   DESCRIPTION
     "This group contains provisionable attributes which specify the VCC 
      space to be supported by this ATM interface. The VCC space 
      consists of an optional 'VPI Zero VCC Space' and an optional 
      'Programmable VCC Space'. If not specified otherwise, the 
      semantic checks described below are applicable only for the CQC-
      based cards.
      
      
      The VPI Zero VCC Space is used to support VCCs with a VPI of 
      zero. The VCI values supported in this space range from 0 to a 
      provisioned maximum. The size of the VPI Zero VCC Space must 
      either be 0 or a multiple of 256. A value of 0 implies that no 
      programmable VCCs can be used. In this case 
      numNonZeroVpisForVccs must also be 0.
      
      The optional Programmable VCC Space is used to support VCCs 
      with a VPI other than zero. The VPI values supported in this space 
      must lie in a single contiguous range which excludes VPI 0. The 
      VCI values supported in this space range from 0 to a provisioned 
      maximum. The size of the Programmable VCC Space (should it 
      exist) must adhere to the following rules:
      
      If (firstNonZeroVpiForVccs = 1) THEN
      (numNonZeroVpisForVccs + 1) * numVccsPerNonZeroVpi
      must be a multiple of 256
      OTHERWISE
      numNonZeroVpisForVccs * numVccsPerNonZeroVpi
      must be a multiple of 256
      
      The number of connection identifier resources in the VCC and VPC 
      space can be determined as follows:
      
      The number of connection identifier resources in the VCC and VPC 
      space (not all of which are available for user connections) is 
      reported in the Lp/n Eng Arc totalConnectionPoolAvailable 
      attribute, and can be determined as follows:
      
      IF (numNonZeroVpisForVccs = 0) THEN
      number of connection ID resources =
      256 + numVccsForVpiZero
      OTHERWISE IF (firstNonZeroVpiForVccs = 1) THEN
      number of connection ID resources =
      256 + numVccsForVpiZero +
      (numNonZeroVpisForVccs + 1) * numVccsPerNonZeroVpi
      OTHERWISE
      number of connection ID resources =
      256 + numVccsForVpiZero +
      (numNonZeroVpisForVccs * numVccsPerNonZeroVpi)
      
      The number of connection identifier resources must not exceed the 
      capacity of the port to which the interface is linked. If the Lp has an 
      Eng Arc Cqc Ov component provisioned with a non-zero 
      connectionPoolCapacity the port's capacity is specified by this 
      attribute. Otherwise the port's capacity is indicated by the Lp/n Eng 
      Arc totalConnectionPoolAvailable divided by the number of 
      physical ports on the card."

     "This attribute specifies the tolerable cell loss ratio (CLR) for CBR 
      traffic except for connections managed by a Vpt CA. The number is 
      the negative logarithm (base 10) of the CLR. For example, if the

      be the same as the RtVbr cellLossRatio since CBR and rt-VBR 
      traffic have the same discard priority. The Cbr cellLossRatio is used 
      by the Connection Admission Control (CAC) algorithm to compute 
      the required (equivalent) cell rate for CBR connections. 
      
      There is a trade-off between the service category CLR and the 
      achievable link utilization. To guarantee an excellent service 
      category, the CLR should be as small as possible (e.g., 1E-10). 
      However, a smaller CLR results in a larger equivalent cell rate for a 
      given connection and hence a lower link utilization.
      
      Setting this attribute to 0 means that a CLR of 1 can be tolerated. In 
      this case, no bandwidth is reserved for CBR connections, and CAC 
      is effectively turned off. All CBR connections are admitted."

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute specifies the default maximum queue length for the 
      emission queues used to buffer the traffic of the CBR service 
      category. It is used as the basis for setting the discard thresholds on 
      both common and per-VC queues. For the common queue, the 
      discard thresholds are set at approximately 35, 75, and 90 percent of 
      the value of this attribute for traffic at discard priority 3 (DP=3), 
      DP=2 and DP=1 respectively.
      
      For a per-VC queue, the actual limit may be reduced depending on 
      the shaping rate of the connection (for standard Vpt Vccs, this is the 
      shaping rate of the Vpt). The discard thresholds are set at 
      approximately 35, 75 and 90 percent of the scaled queue limit for 
      traffic at discard priority 3 (DP=3), DP=2 and DP=1 respectively. 
      However, a reduction will never result in a value that is less than the 
      value set for the minPerVcQueueLimit attribute. CQC-based ATM 
      cards and 1pOC12SmLrAtm cards do not support per-VC queues at 
      the CBR service category.
      
      When this attribute is set to autoConfigure, an appropriate value is 
      selected based on the card type. It is set to 96 for all Passport ATM 
      cards (DS1, E1, IMA, JT2, DS3, E3, OC3, both CQC- and ATM IP-
      based), except 1pOC12SmLrAtm. For the 1pOC12SmLrAtm card, 
      the value is set to 350.
      
      For ATM IP FPs, the per-VC queue limit may be overridden for a 
      permanent connection by specifying a value in the Vcd Tm or Vpd 
      Tm txQueueLimit attribute.
      
      For CQC-based ATM cards, the valid range for this attribute is from 
      5 to 30000 inclusive.
      
      The operational value of the maximum length of a queue (common 
      or per-VC) is indicated by the Vcc Tm, Vpc Tm, or Vpt Tm 
      txQueueThresholds attribute.
      
      For standard Vpts, this attribute does not apply when using per-VC 
      queuing and only applies when using common queueing. When 
      using per-VC queueing, regardless of the Vpt's service category, 
      standard Vpts use the AtmIf Ca NrtVbr txQueueLimit value as their 
      default.

      Vpd Tm component.
      
      When this attribute is set to disabled, traffic shaping cannot be 
      enabled for any CBR connections. 
      
      For CQC-based ATM FPs and 1pOC12SmLrAtm FPs, this attribute 
      must be set to disabled. Traffic shaping is not supported for CBR 
      connections on CQC-based ATM FPs. 
      
      If the Vcc Tm, Vpc Tm, or Vpt Tm, txTrafficDescType indicates type 
      1 or 2, this attribute is ignored, and traffic shaping is not applicable

      When this attribute is set to inverseUpc, traffic shaping for a 
      connection is enabled according to the value of the Vcc Tm, Vpc 
      Tm, or Vpt Tm txTrafficDescType. For 4pOC12SmIrAtm and 
      4pOC12SmLrAtm cards, inverseUpc shaping is not available.
      
      If this attribute is set to inverseUpc, and the txTrafficDescType is 3, 
      4, or 5, linear traffic shaping is enabled. Linear traffic shaping uses 
      a single static traffic shaping rate. 
      
      If this attribute is set to inverseUpc, and the txTrafficDescType is 6, 
      7, or 8, inverse-UPC (also referred to as VBR or dual leaky bucket) 
      traffic shaping is enabled. Inverse-UPC traffic shaping can burst 
      above the sustained cell rate to the peak cell rate for the duration 
      defined by maximum burst size. Inverse-UPC traffic shaping exactly 
      conforms to the requirements of a dual leaky bucket UPC enforcer. 
      
      When this attribute is set to enabled and the txTrafficDescType is 3, 
      4, 5, 6, 7, or 8, traffic shaping for a connection is enabled using 
      linear shaping. 
      
      Enabling or disabling traffic shaping may require a matching 
      change to the emissionPriority attribute and 
      unshapedTransmitQueueing attribute for this service category.

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute specifies the shaping recoup policy for the CBR 
      service category. This is the policy which is used to recoup shaping 
      opportunities which are lost when more than one connection 
      schedules a cell for the same transmit opportunity. In this case, one 
      connection is scheduled, and the cell from the other connection is 
      delayed by one cell time. This attribute affects how the transmit 
      time is calculated for the next cell on the delayed connection. This 
      attribute is ignored if this service category is not shaped.
      
      When the connection which was delayed schedules the next cell to 
      transmit, it may calculate the time as a difference from either the 
      previous actual cell transmit time, or the time when the previous 
      cell should have been transmitted.
      
      Setting this attribute to maximumEfficiency results in each 
      connection trying to recoup or regain any delays in scheduling. The 
      transmit time from the next cell is calculated from the time when 
      the cell should originally have been sent. Cell delay variation 
      (CDV) occurs in this case since the cells are sent with less than the 
      shaping delay between them. However, in general the shaper 
      recovers (recoups) lost opportunities and improves efficiency.
      
      Setting this attribute to minimumCdv results in connections not 
      trying to recoup or regain any delays in scheduling. The transmit 
      time for the next cell is calculated from the time when the previous 
      cell was actually transmitted. This minimizes CDV, but results in 
      missed cell opportunities.

      Per-VC queueing means that each connection has its own buffering

      Common queueing means that cells are queued in First In First Out

     "This attribute specifies the default policy which is applied when

      determines the relative amount of bandwidth which that connection 
      obtains, compared to other connections in the same service 
      category. Connections with equal weight get equal transmit 
      opportunities. Connections with higher weights get more transmit 
      opportunities compared with connections that have lower weights. 
      An override to this default may be specified for a provisioned 
      connection under the Vcd Tm or Vpd Tm component. 
      
      The fairness weight for a connection is directly proportional to the

      This attribute specifies which traffic descriptor parameter is used for

      also ignored on ATM IP cards if unshapedTransmitQueueing is set

      If this attribute is set to scr, the fairness weight is proportional to the 
      transmit sustained cell rate (SCR) of a connection. Connections 
      with a higher SCR have a higher fairness weight. For connections 
      with txTrafficDescType 3, which have no SCR, the sustained cell 
      rate is assumed to be equal to the peak cell rate. 
      
      If this attribute is set to pcr, the fairness weight is proportional to 
      the transmit peak cell rate (PCR) of a connection. Connections with

      the equivalent cell rate (ECR) of a connection as calculated by 
      connection admission control (CAC). Connections with a higher

     "This attribute specifies the tolerable cell loss ratio (CLR) for rt-

      number is the negative logarithm (base 10) of the CLR. For 
      example, if the target CLR = 1E-10 then RtVbr cellLossRatio = 10. 
      This number must be the same as the Cbr cellLossRatio since CBR 
      and rt-VBR traffic have the same discard priority. The RtVbr 
      cellLossRatio is used by the Connection Admission Control (CAC) 
      algorithm to compute the required (equivalent) cell rate for rt-VBR 
      connections. This number must be less than or equal to the NrtVbr 
      cellLossRatio, since rt-VBR traffic has a higher discard priority.
      
      There is a trade-off between the service category CLR and the 
      achievable link utilization. To guarantee an excellent service 
      category, the CLR should be as small as possible (e.g., 1E-10). 
      However, a smaller CLR results in a larger equivalent cell rate for a 
      given connection and hence a lower link utilization. 
      
      Setting this attribute to 0 means that a CLR of 1 can be tolerated. In

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute specifies the default maximum queue length for the 
      emission queues used to buffer the traffic of the rt-VBR service 
      category. It is used as the basis for setting the discard thresholds on 
      both common and per-VC queues. For the common queue, the 
      discard thresholds are set at approximately 35, 75, and 90 percent of 
      the value of this attribute for traffic at discard priority 3 (DP=3), 
      DP=2, and DP=1 respectively. 
      
      For a per-VC queue, the actual limit may be reduced depending on 
      the shaping rate of the connection (for standard Vpt Vccs, this is the 
      shaping rate of the Vpt). The discard thresholds are set at 
      approximately 35, 75, and 90 percent of the scaled queue limit for 
      traffic at discard priority 3 (DP=3), DP=2, and DP=1, respectively. 
      However, a reduction will never result in a value that is less than the 
      value set for the minPerVcQueueLimit attribute.
      
      When the value of this attribute is autoConfigure, an appropriate 
      value is selected based on the card type. It is set to 288 for low 
      speed cards such as DS1, E1 and IMA, and set to 480 for high 
      speed cards such as JT2, DS3, E3 and OC3 (including ATM IP 
      FPs). For the 1pOC12SmLrAtm card, the value is set to 2048.
      For the 1pOC48SmSrAtm card, the value is set to 12288.
      
      For ATM IP FPs, the per-VC queue limit may be overridden for a 
      permanent connection by specifying a value in the Vcd Tm or Vpd 
      Tm txQueueLimit attribute. 
      
      For CQC-based ATM cards, the valid range for this attribute is from 
      5 to 30000 inclusive.
      
      For 1pOC48SmSrAtm cards, the value of this attribute is used to set 
      the maximum size of the link-class queue for buffering this traffic 
      type on the egress path.
      
      The operational value of the maximum length of a queue (common 
      or per-VC) is indicated by the Vcc Tm, Vpc Tm, or Vpt Tm 
      txQueueThresholds attribute.
      
      For standard Vpts, this attribute does not apply when using per-VC 
      queuing and only applies when using common queueing. When 
      using per-VC queueing, regardless of the Vpt's service category, 
      standard Vpts use the AtmIf Ca NrtVbr txQueueLimit value as their 
      default.

      This attribute specifies the emission priority (EP) which is used to 
      transmit traffic of the rt-VBR service category. A lower numerical 
      value for this attribute specifies a higher emission priority. 0 is the 
      highest EP and 7 is the lowest. Cells at a higher emission priority 
      receive higher preference for link bandwidth. EPs 0 and 1 are in the 
      absolute priority range, and are unaffected by any minimum 
      bandwidth guarantees. EPs 2 through 7 are in the guaranteed 
      bandwidth range. Minimum bandwidth guarantee is specified in the 
      AtmIf/n Ep/m component. 
      
      Emission priority setting must comply with all of the following

      1. The emission priority numbers must be in the following order:

      same EP with CBR or ABR. If either one of CBR or rt-VBR are 
      not shaped, then they cannot share the same EP.

      When this attribute is set to inverseUpc, traffic shaping for a

      VBR or dual leaky bucket) traffic shaping is enabled. Inverse-UPC 
      traffic shaping can burst above the sustained cell rate to the peak

      attribute is ignored if this service category is not shaped.
      
      When the connection which was delayed schedules the next cell to

      cell should have been transmitted.

      the cell should originally have been sent. Cell delay variation 
      (CDV) occurs in this case since the cells are sent with less than the 
      shaping delay between them. However, in general the shaper 
      recovers (recoups) lost opportunities and improves efficiency.
      
      Setting this attribute to minimumCdv results in connections not

      Per-VC queueing means that each connection has its own buffering

      Common queueing means that cells are queued in First In First Out

      the value autoConfigure is interpreted to mean per-VC queueing.
      
      For ATM IP cards, if traffic shaping for this service category is not 
      disabled, the only permitted values are perVc and autoConfigure. 
      In this case, the result is that all connections use per-VC queueing.

      of the Lp Eng Arc Cqc component permits shaping for this 
      interface, then this attribute may take any of the three values. In this

     "This attribute specifies the policy which is applied when calculating

      The fairness weight for a connection is directly proportional to the

      If this attribute is set to scr, the fairness weight is proportional to the

      rate is assumed to be equal to the peak cell rate. 
      
      If this attribute is set to pcr, the fairness weight is proportional to

     "This attribute specifies the tolerable cell loss ratio (CLR) for nrt-

      This number must be greater than or equal to RtVbr cellLossRatio 
      since rt-VBR traffic has a higher discard priority. The NrtVbr 
      cellLossRatio is used by the Connection Admission Control (CAC) 
      algorithm to compute the required (equivalent) cell rate for nrt-VBR 
      connections. 
      
      There is a trade-off between the service category CLR and the 
      achievable link utilization. To guarantee an excellent service 
      category, the CLR should be as small as possible (e.g., 1E-10). 
      However, a smaller CLR results in a larger equivalent cell rate for a 
      given connection and hence a lower link utilization. 
      
      Setting this attribute to 0 means that a CLR of 1 can be tolerated. In 
      this case no bandwidth is reserved for nrt-VBR connections, and

      For per-VC queue, the actual limit may be reduced depending on

      Tm txQueueLimit attribute. 
      
      For the 1pOC48SmSrAtm card, the value of this attribute is used to 
      set the maximum size of the link-class queue for buffering the nrt-

      This attribute specifies the emission priority (EP) which is used to 
      transmit traffic of the nrt-VBR service category. A lower numerical 
      value for this attribute specifies a higher emission priority. 0 is the 
      highest EP and 7 is the lowest. Cells at a higher emission priority 
      receive higher preference for link bandwidth. EPs 0 and 1 are in the 
      absolute priority range, and are unaffected by any minimum 
      bandwidth guarantees. EPs 2 through 7 are in the guaranteed 
      bandwidth range. Minimum bandwidth guarantee is specified in the 
      AtmIf/n Ep/m component. 
      
      Emission priority setting must comply with all of the following 
      constraints: 
      1. The emission priority numbers must be in the following order: 
      CBR <= rt-VBR <= nrt-VBR <= ABR <= UBR 
      2. Two different ATM service categories may share the same EP 
      only if they are both shaped. 
      3. CBR and rt-VBR may be placed either in the absolute priority 
      range (EP 0 or 1) or in the guaranteed bandwidth range (EP 2 
      through 7). 
      4. If both CBR and rt-VBR are shaped, rt-VBR must share the 
      same EP with CBR or ABR. If either one of CBR or rt-VBR are 
      not shaped, then they cannot share the same EP. 
      5. ABR service category is always deemed to be shaped. If nrt-VBR 
      is shaped, it must share the same EP with ABR. If nrt-VBR is not 
      shaped it must have a higher EP than ABR.
      6. If UBR is shaped, it must share the same EP with ABR. If UBR 
      is not shaped, it must have a lower EP than ABR.

      Tm or Vpd Tm component.
      
      When this attribute is set to disabled, traffic shaping cannot be 
      enabled for any nrt-VBR connections. On 1pOC12SmLrAtm and 
      1pOC48SmSrAtm cards, this attribute must be set to disabled.
      
      For CQC-based ATM cards, this attribute may be set to enabled 
      only if the interface supports shaping, as defined by the 
      perVcQueueInterfaces attribute in the AtmResourceControl Cqc 
      Override component. If that component does not exist, this attribute 
      must be set to disabled.
      
      If the Vcc Tm, Vpc Tm, or Vpt Tm txTrafficDescType indicates type 
      1 or 2, this attribute is ignored, and traffic shaping is not applicable 
      for that connection. 
      
      When this attribute is set to inverseUpc, traffic shaping for a 
      connection is enabled according to card type and the value of the 
      Vcc Tm, Vpc Tm, or Vpt Tm txTrafficDescType. For 
      4pOC12SmIrAtm and 4pOC12SmLrAtm cards, inverseUpc shaping 
      is not available.
      
      If this attribute is set to inverseUpc, and the txTrafficDescType is 3, 
      4, or 5, linear traffic shaping is enabled. Linear traffic shaping uses 
      a single static traffic shaping rate. 
      
      On CQC-based ATM FPs, if this attribute is set to inverseUpc, and 
      the txTrafficDescType is 6, 7, or 8, linear traffic shaping is enabled.
      
      On ATM IP FPs, if this attribute is set to inverseUpc, and the 
      txTrafficDescType is 6, 7, or 8, inverse-UPC (also referred to as 
      VBR or dual leaky bucket) traffic shaping is enabled. Inverse-UPC 
      traffic shaping can burst above the sustained cell rate to the peak 
      cell rate for the duration defined by maximum burst size. Inverse-
      UPC traffic shaping exactly conforms to the requirements of a dual 
      leaky bucket UPC enforcer. 
      
      When this attribute is set to enabled and the txTrafficDescType is 3, 
      4, 5, 6, 7, or 8, traffic shaping for a connection is enabled using

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute specifies the shaping recoup policy for the nrt-VBR 
      service category. This is the policy which is used to recoup shaping 
      opportunities which are lost when more than one connection 
      schedules a cell for the same transmit opportunity. In this case, one 
      connection is scheduled, and the cell from the other connection is 
      delayed by one cell time. This attribute affects how the transmit 
      time is calculated for the next cell on the delayed connection. This 
      attribute is ignored if this service category is not shaped.
      
      When the connection which was delayed schedules the next cell to 
      transmit, it may calculate the time as a difference from either the 
      previous actual cell transmit time, or the time when the previous 
      cell should have been transmitted.
      
      Setting this attribute to maximumEfficiency results in each 
      connection trying to recoup or regain any delays in scheduling. The 
      transmit time from the next cell is calculated from the time when 
      the cell should originally have been sent. Cell delay variation 
      (CDV) occurs in this case since the cells are sent with less than the 
      shaping delay between them. However, in general the shaper 
      recovers (recoups) lost opportunities and improves efficiency.
      
      Setting this attribute to minimumCdv results in connections not 
      trying to recoup or regain any delays in scheduling. The transmit 
      time for the next cell is calculated from the time when the previous 
      cell was actually transmitted. This minimizes CDV, but results in

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute specifies the default queuing option for unshaped 
      connections of the nrt-VBR service category. This attribute controls 
      whether common or per-VC queueing is used. 
      
      Per-VC queueing means that each connection has its own buffering 
      and queue limits.
      
      Common queueing means that cells are queued in First In First Out 
      order on a common queue. The common queue has one set of 
      congestion control levels for all cells enqueued on it. For ATM IP 
      cards, there is one common queue for the nrt-VBR service category. 
      For CQC-based ATM cards, there is one common queue which is 
      shared by the nrt-VBR, ABR and UBR service categories. 
      
      For ATM IP cards, if traffic shaping for this service category is 
      disabled, this attribute may take any of the three values. In this case, 
      the value autoConfigure is interpreted to mean per-VC queueing.
      
      For 1pOC12SmLrAtm and 1pOC48SmSrAtm cards this attribute 
      must be set to common or autoConfigure. This attribute cannot be 
      set to perVc since per-Vc queueing is not available on the 
      1pOC12SmLrAtm and 1pOC48SmSrAtm cards. The value 
      autoConfigure is interpreted to mean common queueing.
      
      For ATM IP cards, if traffic shaping for this service category is not 
      disabled, the only permitted values are perVc and autoConfigure. 
      In this case, the result is that all connections use per-VC queueing.
      
      For CQC-based ATM cards, if the perVcQueueInterfaces attribute 
      of the Lp Eng Arc Cqc component permits shaping for this 
      interface, then this attribute may take any of the three values. In this 
      case, the value autoConfigure is interpreted to mean per-VC 
      queueing. For 4pOC12SmIrAtm and 4pOC12SmLrAtm cards only 
      perVc queueing is supported. All other attribute values are ignored.
      
      
      For CQC-based ATM cards, if the perVcQueueInterfaces attribute 
      of the Lp Eng Arc Cqc component does not permit shaping for this 
      interface, then this attribute may take the values common or 
      autoConfigure. In this case, the value autoConfigure is interpreted 
      to mean common queueing. 
      
      If this attribute is set to autoConfigure, an override to this default 
      may be specified for a provisioned connection under the Vcd Tm or 
      Vpd Tm component. 
      
      The opUnshapedTransmitQueueing attribute of this component

      An override to this default may be specified for a provisioned

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute specifies the policy which is applied when calculating 
      the fairness weight for unshaped connections of the nrt-VBR 
      service category. The fairness weight for a connection determines 
      the relative amount of bandwidth which that connection obtains, 
      compared to other connections in the same service category. 
      Connections with equal weight get equal transmit opportunities. 
      Connections with higher weights get more transmit opportunities 
      compared with connections that have lower weights. An override to 
      this default may be specified for a provisioned connection under the 
      Vcd Tm or Vpd Tm component. 
      
      The fairness weight for a connection is directly proportional to the 
      value of one of the traffic descriptor parameters for that connection. 
      This attribute specifies which traffic descriptor parameter is used for 
      connections of the nrt-VBR service category. 
      
      This attribute is ignored on CQC-based ATM cards. This attribute is 
      also ignored on ATM IP cards if unshapedTransmitQueueing is set 
      for common queuing. 
      
      This attribute is also ignored for 1pOC48SmSrAtm cards.
      
      If this attribute is set to scr, the fairness weight is proportional to the 
      transmit sustained cell rate (SCR) of a connection. Connections 
      with a higher SCR have a higher fairness weight. For connections 
      with txTrafficDescType 3, which have no SCR, the sustained cell 
      rate is assumed to be equal to the peak cell rate. 
      
      If this attribute is set to pcr, the fairness weight is proportional to 
      the transmit peak cell rate (PCR) of a connection. Connections with 
      a higher PCR have a higher fairness weight. Connections with 
      txTrafficDescType 1 or 2 get a minimum weight, which is 1. 
      
      If this attribute is set to ecr, the fairness weight is proportional to 
      the equivalent cell rate (ECR) of a connection as calculated by 
      connection admission control (CAC). Connections with a higher 
      ECR have a higher fairness weight. Connections with an ECR of 0 
      get a minimum weight, which is 1. 
      
      The weight of a connection is visible in the Vcc Tm, Vpc Tm, or Vpt

      This attribute specifies the emission priority (EP) which is used to

      value for this attribute specifies a higher emission priority. 0 is the 
      highest EP and 7 is the lowest. Cells at a higher emission priority 
      receive higher preference for link bandwidth. EPs 0 and 1 are in the 
      absolute priority range, and are unaffected by any minimum 
      bandwidth guarantees. EPs 2 through 7 are in the guaranteed 
      bandwidth range. Minimum bandwidth guarantee is specified in the

      through 7). 
      4. If both CBR and rt-VBR are shaped, rt-VBR must share the 
      same EP with CBR or ABR. If either one of CBR or rt-VBR are 
      not shaped, then they cannot share the same EP.

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute specifies the default Cutoff Decrease Factor (CDF) 
      parameter for ABR connections. An override to this default may be 
      specified for a provisioned connection under the Vcd Tm Abr or Vpd 
      Tm Abr component, or signalled in the ABR Additional Parameters 
      Information Element.
      
      When the value of this attribute is non-zero, CDF is computed as 
      the inverse of the value. For example, if the value is 32, the value of 
      CDF is 1/32. When the value of this attribute is 0, CDF is also zero.
      
      CDF controls the decrease in the Allowed Cell Rate (ACR) 
      associated with the CRM parameter. CRM is the limit of the 
      number of forward Resource Management (F-RM) cells which may 
      be sent in the absence of received backward RM cells. When this 
      limit is crossed, the ACR value would be decreased by the amount 
      (CDF*ACR). The ACR is not allowed to fall below the MCR, in 
      which case the ACR is set to MCR."

      ADTF is the time interval permitted between sending forward

      the source does not transmit a forward RM cell for a period of 
      ADTF centi-seconds (hundredths of a second), it will reduce its 
      ACR to the value of its ICR. If ACR is already at or below ICR, 
      further rate reductions are defined by the CRM ABR parameter."

      4pOC12SmLrAtm cards, the reference rate is set to 65511 for DS3 
      and OC3 channels, and set to 262044 for OC12 channels. For Apc-

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute is not applicable and is ignored for CQC-based ATM 
      cards.
      
      This attribute specifies the emission priority (EP) which is used to 
      transmit traffic of the UBR service category. A lower numerical 
      value for this attribute specifies a higher emission priority. 0 is the 
      highest EP and 7 is the lowest. Cells at a higher emission priority 
      receive higher preference for link bandwidth. EPs 0 and 1 are in the 
      absolute priority range, and are unaffected by any minimum 
      bandwidth guarantees. EPs 2 through 7 are in the guaranteed 
      bandwidth range. Minimum bandwidth guarantee is specified in the 
      AtmIf/n Ep/m component. 
      
      Emission priority setting must comply with all of the following 
      constraints: 
      1. The emission priority numbers must be in the following order: 
      CBR <= rt-VBR <= nrt-VBR <= ABR <= UBR 
      2. Two different ATM service categories may share the same EP 
      only if they are both shaped. 
      3. CBR and rt-VBR may be placed either in the absolute priority 
      range (EP 0 or 1) or in the guaranteed bandwidth range (EP 2 
      through 7). 
      4. If both CBR and rt-VBR are shaped, rt-VBR must share the 
      same EP with CBR or ABR. If either one of CBR or rt-VBR are 
      not shaped, then they cannot share the same EP. 
      5. ABR service category is always deemed to be shaped. If nrt-VBR 
      is shaped, it must share the same EP with ABR. If nrt-VBR is not 
      shaped it must have a higher EP than ABR.
      6. If UBR is shaped, it must share the same EP with ABR. If UBR 
      is not shaped, it must have a lower EP than ABR.

      When this attribute is set to disabled, traffic shaping cannot be 
      enabled for any UBR connection. On 1pOC12SmLrAtm cards, this 
      attribute must be set to disabled.
      
      For CQC-based ATM cards, this attribute may be set to enabled 
      only if the interface supports shaping, as defined by the 
      perVcQueueInterfaces attribute in the AtmResourceControl Cqc 
      Override component. If that component does not exist, this attribute 
      must be set to disabled.
      
      If the Vcc Tm, Vpc Tm, or Vpt Tm txTrafficDescType indicates type 
      1 or 2, this attribute is ignored, and traffic shaping is not applicable 
      for that connection. 
      
      When this attribute is set to inverseUpc, traffic shaping for a 
      connection is enabled according to card type and the value of the 
      Vcc Tm, Vpc Tm, or Vpt Tm txTrafficDescType. For 
      4pOC12SmIrAtm and 4pOC12SmLrAtm cards, inverseUpc shaping 
      is not available.
      
      If this attribute is set to inverseUpc, and the txTrafficDescType is 3, 
      4, or 5, linear traffic shaping is enabled. Linear traffic shaping uses 
      a single static traffic shaping rate. 
      
      On CQC-based ATM FPs, if this attribute is set to inverseUpc, and 
      the txTrafficDescType is 6, 7, or 8, linear traffic shaping is enabled.
      
      On ATM IP FPs, if this attribute is set to inverseUpc, and the 
      txTrafficDescType is 6, 7, or 8, inverse-UPC (also referred to as 
      VBR or dual leaky bucket) traffic shaping is enabled. Inverse-UPC 
      traffic shaping can burst above the sustained cell rate to the peak 
      cell rate for the duration defined by maximum burst size. Inverse-
      UPC traffic shaping exactly conforms to the requirements of a dual

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute specifies the shaping recoup policy for the UBR 
      service category. This is the policy which is used to recoup shaping 
      opportunities which are lost when more than one connection 
      schedules a cell for the same transmit opportunity. In this case, one 
      connection is scheduled, and the cell from the other connection is 
      delayed by one cell time. This attribute affects how the transmit 
      time is calculated for the next cell on the delayed connection. This 
      attribute is ignored if this service category is not shaped.
      
      When the connection which was delayed schedules the next cell to 
      transmit, it may calculate the time as a difference from either the 
      previous actual cell transmit time, or the time when the previous 
      cell should have been transmitted.
      
      Setting this attribute to maximumEfficiency results in each 
      connection trying to recoup or regain any delays in scheduling. The 
      transmit time from the next cell is calculated from the time when 
      the cell should originally have been sent. Cell delay variation 
      (CDV) occurs in this case since the cells are sent with less than the 
      shaping delay between them. However, in general the shaper 
      recovers (recoups) lost opportunities and improves efficiency.
      
      Setting this attribute to minimumCdv results in connections not 
      trying to recoup or regain any delays in scheduling. The transmit 
      time for the next cell is calculated from the time when the previous 
      cell was actually transmitted. This minimizes CDV, but results in

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute specifies the default queuing option for unshaped 
      connections of the UBR service category. This attribute controls 
      whether common or per-VC queueing is used. 
      
      Per-VC queueing means that each connection has its own buffering 
      and queue limits.
      
      Common queueing means that cells are queued in First In First Out 
      order on a common queue. The common queue has one set of 
      congestion control levels for all cells enqueued on it. For ATM IP 
      cards, there is one common queue for the UBR service category. 
      For CQC-based ATM cards, there is one common queue which is 
      shared by the nrt-VBR, ABR and UBR service categories.
      
      For 1pOC12SmLrAtm cards this attribute must be set to common or 
      autoConfigure. This attribute cannot be set to perVc since per-Vc 
      queueing is not available on the 1pOC12SmLrAtm card. The value 
      autoConfigure is interpreted to mean common queueing.
      
      For ATM IP cards, if traffic shaping for this service category is 
      disabled, this attribute may take any of the three values. In this case, 
      the value autoConfigure is interpreted to mean per-VC queueing.
      
      For ATM IP cards, if traffic shaping for this service category is not 
      disabled, the only permitted values are perVc and autoConfigure. 
      In this case, the result is that all connections use per-VC queueing.
      
      For CQC-based ATM cards, if the perVcQueueInterfaces attribute 
      of the Lp Eng Arc Cqc component permits shaping for this 
      interface, then this attribute may take any of the three values. In this 
      case, the value autoConfigure is interpreted to mean per-VC 
      queueing. For 4pOC12SmIrAtm and 4pOC12SmLrAtm cards only 
      perVc queueing is supported. All other attribute values are ignored.
      
      
      For CQC-based ATM cards, if the perVcQueueInterfaces attribute 
      of the Lp Eng Arc Cqc component does not permit shaping for this 
      interface, then this attribute may take the values common or 
      autoConfigure. In this case, the value autoConfigure is interpreted 
      to mean common queueing.
      
      If this attribute is set to autoConfigure, an override to this default 
      may be specified for a provisioned connection under the Vcd Tm or 
      Vpd Tm component.

     "This attribute specifies the policy which is applied when calculating

      compared to other connections in the same service category. 
      Connections with equal weight get equal transmit opportunities. 
      Connections with higher weights get more transmit opportunities

      this default may be specified for a provisioned connection under the

      If this attribute is set to mcr, the fairness weight is proportional to 
      the default minimum cell rate (MCR) for UBR connections. If the 
      default minimum cell rate is 0, all UBR connections get a minimum 
      weight, which is 1. 
      
      If this attribute is set to pcr, the fairness weight is proportional to 
      the transmit peak cell rate (PCR) of a connection. Connections with 
      a higher PCR have a higher fairness weight. Connections with

      If this attribute is set to ecr, the fairness weight is proportional to 
      the equivalent cell rate (ECR) of a connection as calculated by 
      connection admission control (CAC). Connections with a higher 
      ECR have a higher fairness weight. Connections with an ECR of 0

     "This attribute indicates the Early Packet Discard (EPD) offset which 
      is currently in use for this service category. The EPD offset is used 
      to derive the EPD thresholds for each CC level.
      
      Any connection under this service category which requires the 
      txPacketWiseDiscard feature must specify a transmit queue limit 
      which is at least 5.71 times this offset. This ensures that the derived 
      Epd threshold will never be less than 17.5 % of the transmit queue 
      limit. If this is not done, txPacketWiseDiscard for the connection 
      will be automatically disabled.
      
      The value of this EPD offset is specified under the lp/x eng arc aqm 
      ov component."

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute contains the current state of the receive side OAM cell 
      congestion for this connection. Its value reflects whether the rate of 
      received OAM cells for this connection is below a specified 
      threshold. The connection maintains a count of the number of OAM 
      cells which are terminated per second. Once that count exceeds the 
      specified threshold, extraction of all OAM cells for this connection 
      is disabled for a period of one minute. This is a congestion 
      management mechanism to prevent the processor from being 
      overloaded with handling OAM cells for a particular connection. 
      This mechanism ensures that tasks, such as trunks obtain enough 
      processor cycles to remain in service, and are not adversely affected 
      by excessive rate of OAM cells on a particular connection.
      
      The value is good when the rate of received OAM cells is less than 
      the allowed threshold.
      
      The value is bad when the arrival rate has exceeded the allowed 
      threshold. It remains bad for one minute, before returning to good 
      again. During this timeout, extraction of all OAM cells is disabled 
      for this connection. As a result, other loopback failure conditions 
      may occur.
      
      The value is unknown when the application has not yet begun to 
      use this connection. An example is the Test component before a test 
      has been started.
      
      Each type of OAM cell is counted separately. The threshold for AIS 
      cells is three cells per second. If more than three AIS cells are 
      received within a one second interval, this attribute is set to bad. 
      The threshold for RDI cells and each loopback type is also three, 
      but the threshold for trace cells is 250 per second.
      
      The state of this attribute has no direct effect on the value of the 
      operStatus attribute or on the number of troubled connections."

      This attribute indicates the ATM service category used for traffic in 
      both directions of the connection. 
      
      The constantBitRate service category is intended for real time 
      applications, that is, those requiring tightly constrained delay and 
      delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video 
      applications. The consistent availability of a fixed quantity of 
      bandwidth is considered appropriate for CBR service. Cells which 
      are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are 
      assumed to have significantly reduced value of the application.
      
      The rtVariableBitRate service category is intended for real time 
      applications; that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and 
      delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video 
      applications. Sources are expected to transmit at a rate which varies 
      with time. Equivalently, the source can be described as 'bursty'. 
      Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer 
      Delay are assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the 
      application. Real time VBR service may support statistical 
      multiplexing of real time sources.
      
      The nrtVariableBitRate service category is intended for non-real 
      time applications which have bursty traffic characteristics and which 
      can be characterized in terms of a PCR, SCR, and MBS. For those 
      cells which are transferred within the traffic contract, the application 
      expects a low cell loss ratio. For all connections, it expects a bound 
      on the mean cell transfer delay. Non-real time VBR service may 
      support statistical multiplexing of connections.
      
      The unspecifiedBitRate service is intended for non-real time 
      applications, that is those not requiring tightly constrained delay 
      and delay variation. UBR sources are expected to be bursty. UBR 
      service supports a high degree of statistical multiplexing among 
      sources. UBR service does not specify traffic related service 
      guarantees. No numerical commitments are made with respect to 
      the cell loss ratio experienced by a UBR connection, or as to the 
      cell transfer delay experienced by cells on the connection."

      where the AAL, trafficType (cbr or vbr) and timing requirements 
      are user defined (that is, transparent to the network). When the 
      value of this attribute is x, the user is requesting an ATM only 
      service from the network. In this case, the network shall not process 
      any higher layer protocol.
      
      Class vp service is used to indicate a transparent VP service when 
      the user is requesting an ATM only service from the network. In this 
      case, the network does not process any higher layer protocol. This 
      service differs from class x service in that with the class vp service 
      both the VCI field (except for VCI values 0, 3, 4, and 6 through 15) 
      and Payload Type field are transported transparently by the network. 
      This attribute value is only applicable to SPVP and SVP 
      connections.

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute is HISTORICAL. Please refer to the attribute of the 
      same name in the group AtmTmOper.
      
      This attribute is a vector of five transmit traffic parameters. The first 
      three elements reflect the settings of the first three elements of the 
      txTrafficDescParm attribute in the AtmTrafficProv group. 
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, parameters 1 through 5 are 
      unused.
      
      In this description, PCR is the greater of either the PCR or the 
      requested shaping rate (parameter 1 or parameter 5) specified in the 
      Traffic group under the Vcd or Vpd.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 or 1 traffic; parameters 2 and 3 are unused.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the 
      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the 
      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8, parameter 4 reflects 
      the actual shaping rate in cell/s for this connection. This rate is one 
      of the set of available shaping rates for this type of ATM-FP, based 
      on the number of interfaces doing shaping (attribute 
      perVcQueueInterfaces), the provisioned cell rate, the 
      shapingScalingFactor attribute of the AtmResourceControl 
      component, and whether traffic shaping is enabled. A rate of zero 
      (0) indicates that shaping is not performed. 
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8, parameter 5 reflects 
      the equivalent cell rate in cell/s for this connection as determined by 
      the Connection Admission Control (CAC) algorithm. The 
      equivalent cell rate is useful in determining the admission 
      characteristics of this connection."

      This attribute is a vector of four traffic parameters whose meanings 
      are defined by the rxTrafficDescType attribute. The values of peak 
      cell rate (PCR), sustained cell rate (SCR) are expressed in cells/s. 
      Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in cells. Cell Delay 
      Variation Tolerance (CDVT) is expressed in microseconds.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, none of the parameters are used.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard; parameter 4 represents the 
      CDVT.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 4 represents the 
      CDVT.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is a 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT. 
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the 
      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the 
      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT. 
      
      If Upc is disabled for this connection, the values of PCR, SCR, 
      MBS and CDVT is a combination of provisioned parameters. If Upc 
      is enabled, the values of PCR, SCR, MBS, and CDVT is exactly the 
      values used by the usage parameter control hardware in policing the 
      arriving traffic. These may vary slightly from the provisioned values 
      due to granularity of the hardware. In the case where the PCR is 
      equal to the SCR, the effective MBS is zero."

      This attribute indicates the queue limit and the discard thresholds 
      for the transmit queue of this connection. 
      
      The first element indicates the queue limit. Depending upon the 
      atmServiceCategory of the connection, the provisioned value of the 
      transmit queue limit is derived from the txQueueLimit attribute 
      under one of the subcomponents of the AtmIf CA component. If the 
      connection has traffic shaping disabled, then this attribute relates to 
      the common queue. If traffic shaping is enabled, then this attribute 
      relates to the per-VC queue.
      
      The second element is the threshold that marks the transition from 
      congestion state 1 to congestion state 0. This is the threshold at 
      which traffic with discard priority (DP) = 1 is discarded. This 
      threshold is set approximately at 90 percent of the first parameter, 
      the operational queue limit.
      
      The third element is the threshold that marks the transition from 
      congestion state 2 to congestion state 1. This is the threshold at 
      which traffic with DP = 2 is discarded. This threshold is set 
      approximately at 75 percent of the first parameter, the operational 
      queue limit.
      
      The fourth element is the threshold that marks the transition from 
      congestion state 3 to congestion state 2. This is the threshold at 
      which traffic with DP = 3 is discarded. This threshold is set 
      approximately at 35 percent of the first parameter, the operational

      This attribute specifies the ATM service category for both directions

      The value derivedFromBBC may only be used if the SrcPvc 
      component is provisioned under this Vcc.Otherwise a specific ATM 
      service category must be specified. 
      
      If this attribute is set to derivedFromBBC, the Broadband Bearer 
      Capability (BBC) and bestEffort attributes are used to determine the 
      atmServiceCategory of this connection. 
      
      If this attribute is set to other than derivedFromBBC, the value of 
      this attribute is used to override the provisioned BBC Information 
      Element parameters. In those cases, the BBC attributes are not used. 
      
      The constantBitRate service category is intended for real time 
      applications, that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and 
      delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video 
      applications. The consistent availability of a fixed quantity of 
      bandwidth is considered appropriate for CBR service. Cells which 
      are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are 
      assumed to be of significantly reduce value to the application.
      
      The rtVariableBitRate service category is intended for real time 
      applications, that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and 
      delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video 
      applications. Sources are expected to transmit at a rate which varies 
      with time. Equivalently, the source can be described as 'bursty'. 
      Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by CTD are 
      assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the application. Real 
      time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of real time 
      sources.
      
      The nrtVariableBitRate service category is intended for non-real 
      time applications which have bursty traffic characteristics and which 
      can be characterized in terms of a PCR, SCR, and MBS. For those 
      cells which are transferred within the traffic contract, the application 
      expects a low cell loss ratio. For all connections, it expects a bound 
      on the mean cell transfer delay. Non-real time VBR service may 
      support statistical multiplexing of connections.
      
      The unspecifiedBitRate service is intended for non-real time 
      applications; that is, those not requiring tightly constrained delay 
      and delay variation. UBR sources are expected to be bursty. UBR 
      service supports a high degree of statistical multiplexing among 
      sources. UBR service does not specify traffic related service 
      guarantees. No numerical commitments are made with respect to 
      the cell loss ratio experienced by a UBR connection, or as to the 
      cell transfer delay experienced by cells on the connection."

      Class a service is a connection-oriented, constant bit rate ATM 
      transport service. Class a service has end to end timing 
      requirements and may require stringent cell loss, cell delay and cell 
      delay variation performance.When a is set, the user is requesting 
      more than an ATM only service. The network may look at the AAL 
      to provide interworking based upon its contents. 
      
      Class c service is a connection-oriented, variable bit rate ATM 
      transport service. Class c service has no end-to-end timing 
      requirements. When c is set, the user is requesting more than an 
      ATM only service. The network interworking function may look at 
      the AAL and provide service based on it.
      
      Class x service is a connection-oriented ATM transport service 
      where the AAL, trafficType (vbr or cbr) and timing requirements 
      are user defined (that is, transparent to the network).When x is set 
      the user is requesting an ATM only service from the network.
      
      Class vp service is used to specify a transparent VP service. When 
      the value of this attribute is vp, the user is requesting an ATM only 
      service from the network. In this case, the network shall not process 
      any higher layer protocol. This service differs from class x service 
      in that with the class vp service both the VCI field (except or VCI 
      values 0, 3, 4, and 6 through 15) and Payload Type field are 
      transported transparently by the network. This attribute value is 
      only applicable to SPVP connections."

      point, this attribute specifies whether the Partial Packet 
      Discard (PPD) function is to be enabled or disabled in the transmit 
      direction at this connecting point. The PPD function allows the 
      connecting point to discard the remainder of a cell-forwarded AAL5 
      frame if one cell of this frame has been discarded. The PPD 
      function increases the 'goodput' of the link, since cells which are

      This attribute is a vector of five traffic parameters whose meanings 
      are defined by the txTrafficDescType attribute. The values of peak 
      cell rate (PCR), sustained cell rate (SCR) and requested shaping rate 
      are expressed in cell/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in 
      cells. CDVT is expressed in microseconds. The values of PCR, 
      SCR, MBS and CDVT are used for connection admission control 
      (CAC). The value of CDVT is only used for connections where the 
      atmServiceCategory is constantBitRate. For all other values of 
      atmServiceCategory, CDVT is ignored. The values of PCR, SCR 
      and requested shaping rate are used to determine the actual shaping 
      rate where traffic shaping is enabled.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, all of the parameters must be set 
      to zero.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and 
      parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value 
      in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is 
      used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be non-zero. Parameters 2 and 3 
      must be zero.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic with cell discard; parameter 2 
      represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 
      represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested 
      shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in 
      parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be 
      greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameters 1 and 2 must be 
      non-zero. Parameter 3 must be zero.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 2 
      represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 
      represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested 
      shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in 
      parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be 
      greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameters 1 and 2 must be 
      non-zero. Parameter 3 must be zero.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and 
      parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value 
      in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is 
      used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. 
      Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 
      5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 
      2.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the MBS 
      for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and 
      parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value 
      in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is 
      used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. 
      Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 
      5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 
      2.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the 
      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; 
      and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero 
      value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result 
      is used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. 
      Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 
      5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 
      2.
      
      Whenever it is valid for PCR to be specified, parameter 5 may also 
      be used to specify a requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in 
      parameter 5 overrides the value in parameter 1 and is used as the 
      peak cell rate in calculations of CAC and shaping rate.
      
      For txTrafficDescType 3, 4 and 5, the transmit traffic is shaped at 
      the next rate less than the PCR. 
      
      For txTrafficDescType 6, 7 and 8, the transmit traffic is shaped at 
      the highest available rate which is between PCR and SCR. 
      However, if there is no available shaping rate between PCR and 
      SCR, traffic is shaped at the next rate above the PCR."

      of CDVT is expressed in microseconds. The values of PCR, SCR, 
      MBS and CDVT are used for usage parameter control (UPC).
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, all of the parameters must be set

      from the ConnectionAdministrator defaults for the particular 
      atmServiceCategory of this connection.
      
      When rxTrafficDescriptorType is 3 through 8, there are certain 
      extreme combinations of rxTrafficDescParm which are outside the 
      capabilities of the UPC hardware. The check prov command detects 
      such cases and generates an error message. If this happens, adjust 
      the parameters until they fall within the supported limits. 
      
      To calculate the limits, use the following formulae:

      applications. The consistent availability of a fixed quantity of 
      bandwidth is considered appropriate for CBR service. Cells which 
      are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are 
      assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the application.
      
      The rtVariableBitRate service category is intended for real time 
      applications, that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and 
      delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video 
      applications. Sources are expected to transmit at a rate which varies 
      with time. Equivalently, the source can be described as 'bursty'. 
      Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by CTD are 
      assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the application. Real 
      time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of real time 
      sources.
      
      The nrtVariableBitRate service category is intended for non-real 
      time applications which have bursty traffic characteristics and which 
      can be characterized in terms of a PCR, SCR, and MBS. For those 
      cells which are transferred within the traffic contract, the application 
      expects a low cell loss ratio. For all connections, it expects a bound 
      on the mean cell transfer delay. Non-real time VBR service may 
      support statistical multiplexing of connections. 
      
      The availableBitRate service is an ATM layer service category for 
      which the limiting ATM layer transfer characteristics provided by 
      the network may change subsequent to connection establishment. 
      ABR service has a flow control mechanism which supports several 
      types of feedback to control the source rate in response to changing 
      ATM layer transfer characteristics. ABR service is not intended to 
      support real-time applications. 
      
      The unspecifiedBitRate service is intended for non-real time 
      applications; that is, those not requiring tightly constrained delay 
      and delay variation. UBR sources are expected to be bursty. UBR 
      service supports a high degree of statistical multiplexing among 
      sources. UBR service does not specify traffic related service 
      guarantees. No numerical commitments are made with respect to 
      the cell loss ratio experienced by a UBR connection, or as to the 
      cell transfer delay experienced by cells on the connection."

     "This attribute specifies whether packet-wise discard functions are to

      connection. Packet-wise discard functions should only be requested 
      if this connection is transferring AAL5 frame traffic. This attribute 
      is not applicable for Vpts.
      
      Packet-wise functions increase the 'goodput' of the link. The 
      transmit packet-wise functions are Early Packet Discard (EPD) and 
      Partial Packet Discard (PPD). 
      
      EPD allows the connection to discard an entire frame once the 
      transmit queue has reached the EPD threshold. EPD increases the 
      'goodput' of a link, since discarding an entire frame means that 
      some queue capacity is guarded for some other frame which is 
      already partially transmitted. All cells of the frame are discarded 
      from the Beginning of Message (BOM) cell up to and including the 
      End of Message (EOM) cell. 
      
      PPD allows the connection to discard the remainder of a cell-
      forwarded AAL5 frame if one cell of this frame has been discarded. 
      All cells are discarded up to but not including the EOM cell. The 
      PPD function increases the 'goodput' of the link, since cells which 
      are only going to be discarded at the AAL5 reassembly point are 
      not transmitted.
      
      On CQC-based ATM cards, the packet-wise discard functions are 
      PPD and EPD. PPD is available at VCC cell-transfer points. PPD is 
      not applicable at frame-cell conversion points, and is not applicable 
      for Vpcs. PPD is configured by this attribute. Packet-wise discard 
      should only be enabled for connections carrying AAL5 
      segmentation traffic. Setting the value to enabled for any other 
      traffic type may result in all traffic being discarded. On CQC-based 
      ATM FPs, EPD is automatically enabled at frame-to-cell conversion 
      points, independent of the setting of this attribute. 
      
      On CQC-based ATM cards, at a permanent VCC connection 
      endpoint, this attribute is not applicable and is ignored. If AAL5 
      segmentation and reassembly has been requested, PPD and Early 
      Packet Discard (EPD) are automatically enabled.
      
      On ATM IP cards, packet-wise discard functions include EPD and 
      PPD. PPD and EPD apply to individual VCCs and VCCs within 
      VPCs at all connection points, including tandem VPC connections. 
      Both PPD and EPD are controlled by this attribute. This attribute 
      may safely be set to enabled for any connection (Vcc or Vpc) on 
      ATM IP FPs since they have the ability to automatically detect 
      AAL5-segmented traffic on a connection, and only enable packet-
      wise discards if AAL5-segmented traffic is detected.
      
      When this attribute is set to enabled, packet-wise discard functions 
      are applied to transmit traffic at this connection point. When this 
      attribute is set to disabled, packet-wise discard functions are not 
      applied to transmit traffic at this connection point.
      
      At a SPVC origin on a PNNI interface, a value of enabled specifies

      Packet-wise functions increase the 'goodput' of the link. The 
      receive packet-wise function is Partial Packet Discard (PPD). 
      
      PPD allows the connection to discard the remainder of a cell-

      for example due to UPC. All cells are discarded up to but not

      of the link, since cells which are only going to be discarded at the 
      AAL5 reassembly point are not transmitted.
      
      PPD is available at all VCC connection points where UPC may be 
      activated. PPD is not applicable for Vpcs. 
      
      On CQC-based ATM FPs, packet-wise discards should only be

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute specifies the type of ABR behavior which is to be 
      enforced at this connection. This attribute is only applicable if the 
      atmServiceCategory attribute is availableBitRate. If the 
      atmServicecategory attribute is not availableBitRate, this attribute 
      value is ignored.
      
      The actual ABR functionality which is in effect is visible in the 
      Vcc/Vpc/Vpt Tm abrConnectionType operational attribute.
      
      For CQC-based ATM cards, the only allowable values are 
      sameAsCa, nonAbrInterworking or abrSwitch. If abrSwitch is 
      selected, the CQC implements EFCI marking behavior.
      
      For the 1pOC12SmLrAtm card, the only allowable values are 
      sameAsCa or abrSwitch. If abrSwitch is selected, EFCI marking 
      behavior is implemented.
      
      sameAsCa is used to request the default behavior as specified in the 
      CA Abr component for this Vcc. Otherwise, this attribute overrides 
      the default behavior. 
      
      virtualSourceDest is used to request that this connection point 
      function as a virtual source/virtual destination. VS/VD functionality 
      is only supported on ATM IP FPs.
      
      sourceDest requires that this connection point function as a S/D for 
      RM cells. S/D mode is automatically invoked at this connection 
      point either if this is a connection end point, or if the next hop 
      connection point is configured as nonAbrInterworking.
      
      nonAbrInterworking is used to request that this connection point 
      function as an interworking between ABR and non-ABR service 
      categories. This means that there are no RM cells on the link side of 
      this connection, and that the next hop connection point is 
      performing as an ABR sourceDest.
      
      abrSwitch is used to request ABR switch behavior for this 
      connection point. The ABR switch behavior is first, to confirm to 
      virtualSourceDest or nonAbrInterworking setting on the next hop, 
      and otherwise to implement ABR ER switch behavior. For CQC-
      based FPs, ABR switch behavior is implemented as EFCI marking."

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute is a vector of five traffic parameters whose meanings 
      are defined by the txTrafficDescType attribute. 
      
      The values of peak cell rate (PCR), sustained cell rate (SCR), 
      Minimum Cell Rate (MCR) and requested shaping rate are 
      expressed in cell/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in 
      cells. CDVT is expressed in microseconds. The values of PCR, 
      SCR, MCR, MBS and CDVT are used for connection admission 
      control (CAC). The value of CDVT is only used for connections 
      where the atmServiceCategory is constantBitRate. For all other 
      values of atmServiceCategory, CDVT is ignored. The values of 
      PCR, SCR, MCR and requested shaping rate are used to determine 
      the actual shaping rate where traffic shaping is enabled.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, all of the parameters must be set 
      to zero.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and 
      parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value 
      in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is 
      used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be non-zero. Parameters 2 and 3 
      must be zero.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic with cell discard; parameter 2 
      represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 
      represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested 
      shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in 
      parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be 
      greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameters 1 and 2 must be 
      non-zero. Parameter 3 must be zero.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 2 
      represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 
      represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested 
      shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in 
      parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be 
      greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameters 1 and 2 must be 
      non-zero. Parameter 3 must be zero.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and 
      parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value 
      in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is 
      used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. 
      Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 
      5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 
      2.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the MBS 
      for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and 
      parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value 
      in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is 
      used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. 
      Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 
      5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 
      2.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the 
      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; 
      and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero 
      value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result 
      is used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. 
      Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 
      5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 
      2.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 9, parameter 1 represents the PCR; 
      parameter 2 represents the CDVT; parameter 3 represents the MCR; 
      parameter 4 and parameter 5 represent are not used and must be 
      zero. Parameter 1 must be non-zero and must be greater than or 
      equal to parameter 3. Parameter 3 may be optionally zero.
      
      Whenever it is valid for PCR to be specified, parameter 5 may also 
      be used to specify a requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in 
      parameter 5 overrides the value in parameter 1 and is used as the 
      peak cell rate in calculations of CAC and shaping rate. When the 
      atmServiceCategory is availableBitRate (ABR), the shaping rate is 
      dynamically chosen, based on the ABR flow control mechanism, as 
      a value between the MCR and the PCR or the requested shaping 
      rate if applicable.
      
      For txTrafficDescType 3, 4 and 5, the transmit traffic is shaped at 
      the next available shaping rate less than the PCR. 
      
      For txTrafficDescType 6, 7 and 8 if linear traffic shaping is selected, 
      the transmit traffic is shaped at the highest available rate which is 
      between PCR and SCR. However, if there is no available shaping 
      rate between PCR and SCR, traffic is shaped at the next rate above 
      the PCR. 
      
      For txTrafficDescType 6, 7 and 8 if inverse-UPC traffic shaping is 
      selected, the transmit traffic is shaped at a variable rate which 
      conforms to the PCR, SCR and MBS of the connection traffic 
      descriptor. Inverse-UPC traffic shaping is available only on ATM IP 
      cards."

     "This attribute is a vector of four traffic parameters whose meanings 
      are defined by the rxTrafficDescType attribute. The values of peak 
      cell rate (PCR), sustained cell rate (SCR) and Minimum Cell Rate 
      (MCR) are expressed in cell/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is 
      expressed in cells. The value of CDVT is expressed in 
      microseconds. The values of PCR, SCR, MCR, MBS and CDVT 
      are used for usage parameter control (UPC).
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, all of the parameters must be set 
      to zero (unused).
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic. Parameter 1 must be non-zero. 
      Parameters 2 and 3 must be set to zero (unused).
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR 
      for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard. Parameters 1 and 2 must be 
      non-zero. Parameter 3 must be set to zero (unused). Parameter 1 
      must be greater than or equal to parameter 2.

      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging. Parameters 1 and 2 must be 
      non-zero. Parameter 3 must be set to zero (unused). Parameter 1 
      must be greater than or equal to parameter 2.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is a 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-
      zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to Parameter 2. 
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the 
      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-
      zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. 
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the 
      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic. Parameter 1, 2 and 3 must be non-
      zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 9, parameter 1 represents the PCR; 
      parameter 2 represents the CDVT; parameter 3 represents the MCR. 
      Parameter 4 is not used and must be zero. Parameter 1,must be non-
      zero and must be greater than or equal to parameter 3. Parameter 3 
      may optionally be zero.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is any value from 3 through 8, parameter 
      4 represents the CDVT. 
      
      If the value of CDVT either in parameter 2 or in parameter 4 is zero, 
      the CDVT is taken from the CA defaults for the particular 
      atmServiceCategory of this connection.
      
      On a CQC-based ATM card, when rxTrafficDescriptorType is 3 
      through 8, there are certain extreme combinations of 
      rxTrafficDescParm which are outside the capabilities of the UPC 
      hardware. The check prov command detects such cases and 
      generates an error message. If this happens, adjust the parameters 
      until they fall within the supported limits. 
      
      To calculate the limits, use the following formulae:
      I1 = 1 000 000 000 / PCR
      L1 = CDVT * 1000
      I2 = 1,000,000,000 / SCR
      L2 = CDVT + (MBS - 1) * (I2 - I1)
      I1 and I2 must be less than or equal to 335,523,840. I1 + L1 must 
      be less than or equal to 1,342,156,800. I2 + L2 must be less than or 
      equal to 1,342,156,800. Note that I2 and L2 only apply when the 
      rxTrafficDescriptorType is 6 through 8.
      
      If the values of I1, L1, I2 or L2 are closer to the limits described 
      above, a further restriction applies. Specifically, if either:
      I1 > 41,940,480 or
      I2 > 41,940,480 or
      I1 + L1 > 167,769,600 or
      I2 + L2 > 167,769,600
      then both I1 and I2 must be greater than 20,480. 
      
      Parameter 5 of the rxTrafficDescParm is always unused. 
      
      If the rxTrafficDescType is sameAsTx, the values provisioned in 
      this attribute are ignored. The traffic parameters for the receive 
      direction are taken from the txTrafficDescParm."

      are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are 
      assumed to have significantly reduced value for the application.
      
      The rtVariableBitRate service category is intended for real time 
      applications; that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and 
      delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video 
      applications. Sources are expected to transmit at a rate which varies 
      with time. Equivalently, the source can be described as 'bursty'. 
      Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer 
      Delay are assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the 
      application. Real time VBR service may support statistical 
      multiplexing of real time sources.
      
      The nrtVariableBitRate service category is intended for non-real 
      time applications which have bursty traffic characteristics and which 
      can be characterized in terms of a PCR, SCR, and MBS. For those 
      cells which are transferred within the traffic contract, the application 
      expects a low cell loss ratio. For all connections, it expects a bound 
      on the mean cell transfer delay. Non-real time VBR service may 
      support statistical multiplexing of connections.
      
      The availableBitRate service is an ATM layer service category for 
      which the limiting ATM layer transfer characteristics provided by 
      the network may change subsequent to connection establishment. 
      ABR service has a flow control mechanism which supports several 
      types of feedback to control the source rate in response to changing 
      ATM layer transfer characteristics. ABR service is not intended to 
      support real-time applications.
      
      The unspecifiedBitRate service is intended for non-real time 
      applications, that is those not requiring tightly constrained delay 
      and delay variation. UBR sources are expected to be bursty. UBR 
      service supports a high degree of statistical multiplexing among 
      sources. UBR service does not specify traffic related service 
      guarantees. No numerical commitments are made with respect to 
      the cell loss ratio experienced by a UBR connection, or as to the 
      cell transfer delay experienced by cells on the connection."

     "This attribute indicates the traffic shaping state of the connection.
      
      A value of notApplicable indicates that traffic shaping is not 
      applicable or not supported for this connection. This is the case:
      - when the txTrafficDescType is 1 or 2.
      - for standard Vpt Vccs and basic Vpts.
      - for CQC-based ATM cards, when the atmServiceCategory is 
      constantBitRate.
      
      In these cases, the value of notApplicable is set regardless of 
      whether traffic shaping is enabled or disabled in the provisioning 
      data.
      
      For the 1pOC12SmLrAtm card, traffic shaping is not available, 
      therefore this attribute is always notApplicable.
      
      A value of disabled indicates that traffic shaping is applicable and 
      supported for the type of connection but has been turned off in the

      A value of linear or inverseUpc indicates that traffic shaping is 
      applicable and supported for the type of connection and has been 
      turned on in the provisioning data. This is the only case that 
      indicates that traffic shaping is performed on the connection. In this 
      case, the actual shaping rate is reflected in the txTrafficDescParm 
      attribute, parameter number 4. A value of linear indicates that 
      traffic is being shaped at the constant rate indicated in 
      txTrafficDescParm 4.
      
      A value of inverseUpc is possible only on ATM IP cards. This value 
      indicates that the shaper strictly conforms to the requirements of a 
      dual leaky bucket UPC enforcer. This value is indicated if traffic 
      shaping is enabled, and the txTrafficDescType for this connection is 
      6, 7 or 8.
      
      Traffic shaping for connections with atmServiceCategory as 
      availableBitRate (txTrafficDescType 9) depends upon the 
      abrConnectionType attribute. If abrConnectionType is sourceDest 
      or virtualSourceDest, the value of this attribute is linear. If

      value is set to notApplicable.
      
      For CQC-based ATM cards and the 1pOC12SmLrAtm card, the 
      notApplicable, efciSwitch or nonAbrInterworking. In EFCI 
      marking mode, the Explicit Forward Congestion Indication (EFCI) 
      field in the data cell headers is used to indicate transmit queue 
      congestion. 
      
      For ATM IP cards other than 1pOC12SmLrAtm, if the displayed as 
      connectionEndPoint, this attribute has the value sourceDest. In this 
      mode, the ABR Source and Destination behavior is in effect at this 
      connection. This attribute is also sourceDest in the case where the 
      next hop connection is specified as nonAbrInterworking. The next 
      hop connection is the Vcc or Vpc identified by the nextHop attribute 
      of the Nrp or Rp component. 
      
      If the connectionPointType is not connectionEndPoint, the value of 
      this attribute depends upon the abrConnectionType provisioning 
      and the card type to which the traffic is forwarded on the backplane. 
      The default abrConnectionType is provisioned at the CA Abr 
      abrConnectionType attribute, and may be overridden for a 
      provisioned connection in the Vcd Tm abrConnectionType or Vpd 
      Tm abrConnectionType attribute. If the CA Abr abrConnectionType 
      attribute is virtualSourceDest at either one of the two connection 
      points, and if both the connection points are defined on ATM IP 
      cards, virtual source and destination behavior is applied to the 
      connection. In this instance, the attribute displays the value 
      virtualSourceDest.
      
      This attribute has the value erSwitch if ABR explicit rate 
      functionality is in effect at this connection. In this mode, the switch 
      may modify the Explicit Rate (ER) field of backward Resource 
      Management (RM) cells to indicate the status of congestion at this 
      connection point.
      
      This attribute has the value nonAbrInterworking in the case where 
      this connection point is functioning as an SPVC origin for an ABR 
      connection where the link side of this connection is configured as a 
      non-ABR ATM service category. This means that there are no RM 
      cells on the link side of this connection, and that the next hop 
      connection point is performing as an ABR sourceDest."

   ACCESS     not-accessible
   STATUS     mandatory
   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute is a vector of five transmit traffic parameters whose 
      mapping is defined by the txTrafficDescType attribute. 
      
      The values of peak cell rate (PCR), sustained cell rate (SCR), 
      Minimum Cell Rate (MCR), actual cell rate (ACR), explicit rate 
      (ER), equivalent cell rate (ECR), and actual shaping rate are 
      expressed in cell/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in 
      cells. CDVT is expressed in microseconds. 
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, parameters 1 through 5 are 
      unused.
      
      In this description, PCR is the greater of either the PCR or the 
      requested shaping rate (parameter 1 or parameter 5) specified in the 
      txTrafficDescParm attribute under the Vcd Tm or Vpd Tm 
      component.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 or 1 traffic; parameters 2 and 3 are unused.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the 
      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the 
      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8, parameter 4 reflects 
      the actual shaping rate in cell/s for this connection. For CQC-based 
      ATM cards, the set of available shaping rates is based on the 
      number of interfaces doing shaping (attribute 
      perVcQueueInterfaces), and the shapingScalingFactor attribute of 
      the Arc Cqc Override component. A rate of zero (0) indicates that 
      shaping is not performed, or that the interface is down. 
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 9, parameter 1 represents the PCR; 
      parameter 2 represents the Cell Delay Variation Toleration (CDVT); 
      parameter 3 represents the Minimum Cell Rate (MCR); the meaning 
      of parameter 4 depends upon the value of the abrConnectionType 
      attribute. if abrConnectionType is sourceDest or 
      virtualSourceDest, parameter 4 represents the Allowed Cell Rate 
      (ACR); If abrConnectionType is erSwitch, parameter 4 represents 
      the Explicit Rate (ER); and if abrConnectionType is efciSwitch, 
      parameter 4 reflects the actual shaping rate in cell/s for this 
      connection.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, parameter 5 reflects 
      the equivalent cell rate in cell/s for this connection as determined by 
      the Connection Admission Control (CAC) algorithm. The 
      equivalent cell rate is useful in determining the admission 
      characteristics of this connection."

      which traffic with discard priority (DP) = 1 is discarded. This 
      threshold is set at approximately 90 percent of the first parameter, 
      the operational queue limit.
      
      The third element is the threshold that marks the transition from 
      congestion state 2 to congestion state 1. This is the threshold at 
      which traffic with DP = 2 is discarded. This threshold is set at 
      approximately 75 percent of the first parameter, the operational 
      queue limit.
      
      The fourth element is the threshold that marks the transition from 
      congestion state 3 to congestion state 2. This is the threshold at 
      which traffic with DP = 3 is discarded. This threshold is set at

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute indicates the Rate Decrease Factor (RDF) for this

      the value of this attribute is 8, RDF is 2E-8 = 1/256.
      
      RDF controls the amount by which the cell transmission rate may 
      decrease upon receipt of a backward Resource Management (RM) 
      cell. For example, if a backward RM cell is received with the 
      Congestion Indication (CI) field set to 1, the Allowed Cell Rate 
      (ACR) value would be reduced by the amount (RDF*ACR). The 
      ACR is not allowed to fall below the Minimum Cell Rate (MCR), in 
      which case the ACR is set to MCR.

      RIF controls the amount by which the cell transmission rate may 
      increase upon receipt of a backward Resource Management (RM) 
      cell. For example, if a backward RM cell is received with the 
      Congestion Indication (CI) and the No Increase (NI) fields both set

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute indicates the Cutoff Decrease Factor (CDF) parameter 
      for this connection. When the value of this attribute is non-zero, 
      CDF is computed as the inverse of the value. For example, if the 
      value is 32, the value of CDF is 1/32. When the value of this 
      attribute is 0, CDF is also zero.
      
      CDF controls the decrease in the Allowed Cell Rate (ACR) 
      associated with the forwardRmCellLimit attribute, the limit of the 
      number of forward Resource Management (RM) cells which may 
      be sent in the absence of received backward RM cells. When this

      ADTF is the time interval permitted between sending forward 
      Resource Management (RM) cells before the Allowed Cell Rate 
      (ACR) is decreased to initialCellRate. In other words, if the source 
      does not transit a forward RM cell for the period specified by adtf, it 
      reduces its ACR to the value of its initialCellRate.

     "This attribute contains the current state of the receive side OAM cell 
      congestion for this connection. Its value reflects whether the rate of 
      received OAM cells for this connection is below a specified 
      threshold. The connection maintains a count of the number of OAM 
      cells which are terminated per second. Once that count exceeds the 
      specified threshold, extraction of all OAM cells for this connection 
      is disabled for a period of one minute. This is a congestion 
      management mechanism to prevent the processor from being 
      overloaded with handling OAM cells for a particular connection. 
      This mechanism ensures that tasks, such as trunks obtain enough 
      processor cycles to remain in service, and are not adversely affected 
      by excessive rate of OAM cells on a particular connection.
      
      The value is good when the rate of received OAM cells is less than 
      the allowed threshold.
      
      The value is bad when the arrival rate has exceeded the allowed 
      threshold. It remains bad for one minute, before returning to good 
      again. During this timeout, extraction of all OAM cells is disabled 
      for this connection. As a result, other loopback failure conditions 
      may occur.
      
      The value is unknown when the application has not yet begun to 
      use this connection. An example is the Test component before a test 
      has been started.

      This attribute indicates the ATM service category used for traffic in 
      both directions of the connection. 
      
      The constantBitRate service category is intended for real time 
      applications, that is, those requiring tightly constrained delay and 
      delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video 
      applications. The consistent availability of a fixed quantity of 
      bandwidth is considered appropriate for CBR service. Cells which 
      are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are 
      assumed to have significantly reduced value of the application.
      
      The rtVariableBitRate service category is intended for real time 
      applications; that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and 
      delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video 
      applications. Sources are expected to transmit at a rate which varies 
      with time. Equivalently, the source can be described as 'bursty'. 
      Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer 
      Delay are assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the 
      application. Real time VBR service may support statistical 
      multiplexing of real time sources.
      
      The nrtVariableBitRate service category is intended for non-real 
      time applications which have bursty traffic characteristics and which 
      can be characterized in terms of a PCR, SCR, and MBS. For those 
      cells which are transferred within the traffic contract, the application 
      expects a low cell loss ratio. For all connections, it expects a bound 
      on the mean cell transfer delay. Non-real time VBR service may 
      support statistical multiplexing of connections.
      
      The unspecifiedBitRate service is intended for non-real time 
      applications, that is those not requiring tightly constrained delay 
      and delay variation. UBR sources are expected to be bursty. UBR 
      service supports a high degree of statistical multiplexing among 
      sources. UBR service does not specify traffic related service 
      guarantees. No numerical commitments are made with respect to 
      the cell loss ratio experienced by a UBR connection, or as to the 
      cell transfer delay experienced by cells on the connection."

      of the set of available shaping rates for this type of ATM-FP, based 
      on the number of interfaces doing shaping (attribute 
      perVcQueueInterfaces), the provisioned cell rate, the 
      shapingScalingFactor attribute of the AtmResourceControl 
      component, and whether traffic shaping is enabled. A rate of zero 
      (0) indicates that shaping is not performed. 
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8, parameter 5 reflects 
      the equivalent cell rate in cell/s for this connection as determined by 
      the Connection Admission Control (CAC) algorithm. The 
      equivalent cell rate is useful in determining the admission 
      characteristics of this connection."

      This attribute is a vector of four traffic parameters whose meanings 
      are defined by the rxTrafficDescType attribute. The values of peak 
      cell rate (PCR), sustained cell rate (SCR) are expressed in cells/s. 
      Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in cells. Cell Delay 
      Variation Tolerance (CDVT) is expressed in microseconds.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, none of the parameters are used.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard; parameter 4 represents the 
      CDVT.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 4 represents the 
      CDVT.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is a 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT. 
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the

      When rxTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the 
      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT. 
      
      If Upc is disabled for this connection, the values of PCR, SCR, 
      MBS and CDVT is a combination of provisioned parameters. If Upc 
      is enabled, the values of PCR, SCR, MBS, and CDVT is exactly the 
      values used by the usage parameter control hardware in policing the 
      arriving traffic. These may vary slightly from the provisioned values 
      due to granularity of the hardware. In the case where the PCR is 
      equal to the SCR, the effective MBS is zero."

     "This attribute is HISTORICAL. Please refer to the attribute of the 
      same name in the group AtmTmOper.
      
      This attribute indicates the queue limit and the discard thresholds 
      for the transmit queue of this connection. 
      
      The first element indicates the queue limit. Depending upon the 
      atmServiceCategory of the connection, the provisioned value of the 
      transmit queue limit is derived from the txQueueLimit attribute 
      under one of the subcomponents of the AtmIf CA component. If the 
      connection has traffic shaping disabled, then this attribute relates to 
      the common queue. If traffic shaping is enabled, then this attribute 
      relates to the per-VC queue.
      
      The second element is the threshold that marks the transition from 
      congestion state 1 to congestion state 0. This is the threshold at 
      which traffic with discard priority (DP) = 1 is discarded. This 
      threshold is set approximately at 90 percent of the first parameter, 
      the operational queue limit.
      
      The third element is the threshold that marks the transition from 
      congestion state 2 to congestion state 1. This is the threshold at 
      which traffic with DP = 2 is discarded. This threshold is set 
      approximately at 75 percent of the first parameter, the operational 
      queue limit.
      
      The fourth element is the threshold that marks the transition from 
      congestion state 3 to congestion state 2. This is the threshold at 
      which traffic with DP = 3 is discarded. This threshold is set 
      approximately at 35 percent of the first parameter, the operational 
      queue limit."

      This attribute specifies the ATM service category for both directions

      The value derivedFromBBC may only be used if the SrcPvc 
      component is provisioned under this Vcc.Otherwise a specific ATM 
      service category must be specified. 
      
      If this attribute is set to derivedFromBBC, the Broadband Bearer 
      Capability (BBC) and bestEffort attributes are used to determine the 
      atmServiceCategory of this connection. 
      
      If this attribute is set to other than derivedFromBBC, the value of 
      this attribute is used to override the provisioned BBC Information 
      Element parameters. In those cases, the BBC attributes are not used. 
      
      The constantBitRate service category is intended for real time 
      applications, that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and 
      delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video 
      applications. The consistent availability of a fixed quantity of 
      bandwidth is considered appropriate for CBR service. Cells which 
      are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are 
      assumed to be of significantly reduce value to the application.
      
      The rtVariableBitRate service category is intended for real time 
      applications, that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and 
      delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video 
      applications. Sources are expected to transmit at a rate which varies 
      with time. Equivalently, the source can be described as 'bursty'. 
      Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by CTD are 
      assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the application. Real 
      time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of real time 
      sources.
      
      The nrtVariableBitRate service category is intended for non-real 
      time applications which have bursty traffic characteristics and which 
      can be characterized in terms of a PCR, SCR, and MBS. For those 
      cells which are transferred within the traffic contract, the application 
      expects a low cell loss ratio. For all connections, it expects a bound 
      on the mean cell transfer delay. Non-real time VBR service may 
      support statistical multiplexing of connections.
      
      The unspecifiedBitRate service is intended for non-real time 
      applications; that is, those not requiring tightly constrained delay 
      and delay variation. UBR sources are expected to be bursty. UBR 
      service supports a high degree of statistical multiplexing among 
      sources. UBR service does not specify traffic related service 
      guarantees. No numerical commitments are made with respect to 
      the cell loss ratio experienced by a UBR connection, or as to the 
      cell transfer delay experienced by cells on the connection."

      Class a service is a connection-oriented, constant bit rate ATM 
      transport service. Class a service has end to end timing 
      requirements and may require stringent cell loss, cell delay and cell 
      delay variation performance.When a is set, the user is requesting 
      more than an ATM only service. The network may look at the AAL 
      to provide interworking based upon its contents. 
      
      Class c service is a connection-oriented, variable bit rate ATM 
      transport service. Class c service has no end-to-end timing 
      requirements. When c is set, the user is requesting more than an 
      ATM only service. The network interworking function may look at 
      the AAL and provide service based on it.
      
      Class x service is a connection-oriented ATM transport service 
      where the AAL, trafficType (vbr or cbr) and timing requirements 
      are user defined (that is, transparent to the network).When x is set 
      the user is requesting an ATM only service from the network.
      
      Class vp service is used to specify a transparent VP service. When 
      the value of this attribute is vp, the user is requesting an ATM only 
      service from the network. In this case, the network shall not process 
      any higher layer protocol. This service differs from class x service 
      in that with the class vp service both the VCI field (except or VCI

      type results in all traffic being discarded.
      
      If this connection point is a permanent (provisioned) VCC mid-
      point, this attribute specifies whether the Partial Packet 
      Discard (PPD) function is to be enabled or disabled in the transmit 
      direction at this connecting point. The PPD function allows the 
      connecting point to discard the remainder of a cell-forwarded AAL5 
      frame if one cell of this frame has been discarded. The PPD 
      function increases the 'goodput' of the link, since cells which are 
      only going to be discarded by the AAL5 reassembly are not 
      transmitted.

     "This attribute is migrated to the AtmTmProv group.
      
      This attribute is a vector of five traffic parameters whose meanings 
      are defined by the txTrafficDescType attribute. The values of peak 
      cell rate (PCR), sustained cell rate (SCR) and requested shaping rate 
      are expressed in cell/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in 
      cells. CDVT is expressed in microseconds. The values of PCR, 
      SCR, MBS and CDVT are used for connection admission control 
      (CAC). The value of CDVT is only used for connections where the 
      atmServiceCategory is constantBitRate. For all other values of 
      atmServiceCategory, CDVT is ignored. The values of PCR, SCR 
      and requested shaping rate are used to determine the actual shaping 
      rate where traffic shaping is enabled.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, all of the parameters must be set 
      to zero.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and 
      parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value 
      in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is 
      used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be non-zero. Parameters 2 and 3 
      must be zero.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic with cell discard; parameter 2 
      represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 
      represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested 
      shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in 
      parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be 
      greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameters 1 and 2 must be 
      non-zero. Parameter 3 must be zero.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 2 
      represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 
      represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested 
      shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in 
      parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be 
      greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameters 1 and 2 must be 
      non-zero. Parameter 3 must be zero.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and 
      parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value 
      in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is 
      used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. 
      Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 
      5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 
      2.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the MBS 
      for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and 
      parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value 
      in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is 
      used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. 
      Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 
      5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 
      2.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the 
      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; 
      and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero 
      value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result 
      is used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. 
      Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 
      5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 
      2.
      
      Whenever it is valid for PCR to be specified, parameter 5 may also 
      be used to specify a requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in 
      parameter 5 overrides the value in parameter 1 and is used as the 
      peak cell rate in calculations of CAC and shaping rate.
      
      For txTrafficDescType 3, 4 and 5, the transmit traffic is shaped at 
      the next rate less than the PCR. 
      
      For txTrafficDescType 6, 7 and 8, the transmit traffic is shaped at 
      the highest available rate which is between PCR and SCR. 
      However, if there is no available shaping rate between PCR and 
      SCR, traffic is shaped at the next rate above the PCR."

      This attribute is a vector of four traffic parameters whose meanings 
      are defined by the rxTrafficDescType attribute. The values of peak 
      cell rate (PCR) and sustained cell rate (SCR) are expressed in 
      cell/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in cells. The value 
      of CDVT is expressed in microseconds. The values of PCR, SCR, 
      MBS and CDVT are used for usage parameter control (UPC).
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, all of the parameters must be set 
      to zero (unused).
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic. Parameter 1 must be non-zero. 
      Parameters 2 and 3 must be set to zero (unused).
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard. Parameters 1 and 2 must be 
      non-zero. Parameter 3 must be set to zero (unused). Parameter 1 
      must be greater than or equal to parameter 2.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for

      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging. Parameters 1 and 2 must be 
      non-zero. Parameter 3 must be set to zero (unused). Parameter 1 
      must be greater than or equal to parameter 2.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is a 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-
      zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to Parameter 2. 
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the 
      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-
      zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. 
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the 
      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic. Parameter 1, 2 and 3 must be non-
      zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is any value from 3 through 8, parameter 
      4 represents the CDVT. If this value is zero, the CDVT is taken 
      from the ConnectionAdministrator defaults for the particular 
      atmServiceCategory of this connection.
      
      When rxTrafficDescriptorType is 3 through 8, there are certain 
      extreme combinations of rxTrafficDescParm which are outside the 
      capabilities of the UPC hardware. The check prov command detects 
      such cases and generates an error message. If this happens, adjust 
      the parameters until they fall within the supported limits. 
      
      To calculate the limits, use the following formulae:
      I1 = 1 000 000 000 / PCR
      L1 = CDVT * 1000
      I2 = 1 000 000 000 / SCR
      L2 = CDVT + (MBS - 1) * (I2 - I1)
      I1 and I2 must be less than or equal to 335 523 840. I1 + L1 must 
      be less than or equal to 1 342 156 800. I2 + L2 must be less than or 
      equal to 1 342 156 800. Note that I2 and L2 only apply when the 
      rxTrafficDescriptorType is 6 through 8.
      
      If the values of I1, L1, I2 or L2 are closer to the limits described 
      above, a further restriction applies. Specifically, if either:
      I1 > 41 940 480 or
      I2 > 41 940 480 or
      I1 + L1 > 167 769 600 or
      I2 + L2 > 167 769 600
      then both I1 and I2 must be greater than 20 480. 
      
      Parameter 5 of the rxTrafficDescParm is always unused.

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute specifies the ATM service category for both directions 
      of the connection. 
      
      The value derivedFromBBC may only be used if the SrcPvc 
      component is provisioned under this Vcc. Otherwise a specific 
      ATM service category must be specified. 
      
      If this attribute is set to derivedFromBBC, the Broadband Bearer 
      Capability (BBC) and bestEffort attributes are used to determine the 
      atmServiceCategory of this connection. 
      
      If this attribute is set to other than derivedFromBBC, the value of 
      this attribute is used to override the provisioned BBC Information 
      Element parameters. In those cases, the BBC attributes are not used. 
      
      The constantBitRate service category is intended for real time 
      applications, that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and 
      delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video 
      applications. The consistent availability of a fixed quantity of 
      bandwidth is considered appropriate for CBR service. Cells which 
      are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are 
      assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the application.
      
      The rtVariableBitRate service category is intended for real time 
      applications, that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and 
      delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video 
      applications. Sources are expected to transmit at a rate which varies 
      with time. Equivalently, the source can be described as 'bursty'. 
      Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by CTD are 
      assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the application. Real 
      time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of real time 
      sources.
      
      The nrtVariableBitRate service category is intended for non-real 
      time applications which have bursty traffic characteristics and which 
      can be characterized in terms of a PCR, SCR, and MBS. For those 
      cells which are transferred within the traffic contract, the application 
      expects a low cell loss ratio. For all connections, it expects a bound 
      on the mean cell transfer delay. Non-real time VBR service may 
      support statistical multiplexing of connections. 
      
      The availableBitRate service is an ATM layer service category for 
      which the limiting ATM layer transfer characteristics provided by 
      the network may change subsequent to connection establishment. 
      ABR service has a flow control mechanism which supports several 
      types of feedback to control the source rate in response to changing 
      ATM layer transfer characteristics. ABR service is not intended to 
      support real-time applications. 
      
      The unspecifiedBitRate service is intended for non-real time 
      applications; that is, those not requiring tightly constrained delay 
      and delay variation. UBR sources are expected to be bursty. UBR 
      service supports a high degree of statistical multiplexing among 
      sources. UBR service does not specify traffic related service 
      guarantees. No numerical commitments are made with respect to 
      the cell loss ratio experienced by a UBR connection, or as to the 
      cell transfer delay experienced by cells on the connection."

     "This attribute specifies whether packet-wise discard functions are to

      connection. Packet-wise discard functions should only be requested 
      if this connection is transferring AAL5 frame traffic. This attribute 
      is not applicable for Vpts.
      
      Packet-wise functions increase the 'goodput' of the link. The 
      transmit packet-wise functions are Early Packet Discard (EPD) and 
      Partial Packet Discard (PPD). 
      
      EPD allows the connection to discard an entire frame once the 
      transmit queue has reached the EPD threshold. EPD increases the 
      'goodput' of a link, since discarding an entire frame means that 
      some queue capacity is guarded for some other frame which is 
      already partially transmitted. All cells of the frame are discarded 
      from the Beginning of Message (BOM) cell up to and including the 
      End of Message (EOM) cell. 
      
      PPD allows the connection to discard the remainder of a cell-
      forwarded AAL5 frame if one cell of this frame has been discarded. 
      All cells are discarded up to but not including the EOM cell. The 
      PPD function increases the 'goodput' of the link, since cells which 
      are only going to be discarded at the AAL5 reassembly point are 
      not transmitted.
      
      On CQC-based ATM cards, the packet-wise discard functions are 
      PPD and EPD. PPD is available at VCC cell-transfer points. PPD is 
      not applicable at frame-cell conversion points, and is not applicable 
      for Vpcs. PPD is configured by this attribute. Packet-wise discard 
      should only be enabled for connections carrying AAL5 
      segmentation traffic. Setting the value to enabled for any other 
      traffic type may result in all traffic being discarded. On CQC-based 
      ATM FPs, EPD is automatically enabled at frame-to-cell conversion 
      points, independent of the setting of this attribute. 
      
      On CQC-based ATM cards, at a permanent VCC connection 
      endpoint, this attribute is not applicable and is ignored. If AAL5 
      segmentation and reassembly has been requested, PPD and Early 
      Packet Discard (EPD) are automatically enabled.
      
      On ATM IP cards, packet-wise discard functions include EPD and 
      PPD. PPD and EPD apply to individual VCCs and VCCs within 
      VPCs at all connection points, including tandem VPC connections. 
      Both PPD and EPD are controlled by this attribute. This attribute 
      may safely be set to enabled for any connection (Vcc or Vpc) on 
      ATM IP FPs since they have the ability to automatically detect 
      AAL5-segmented traffic on a connection, and only enable packet-
      wise discards if AAL5-segmented traffic is detected.
      
      When this attribute is set to enabled, packet-wise discard functions 
      are applied to transmit traffic at this connection point. When this 
      attribute is set to disabled, packet-wise discard functions are not 
      applied to transmit traffic at this connection point.
      
      At a SPVC origin on a PNNI interface, a value of enabled specifies 
      that frame discard is requested in the backward direction. When this 
      attribute is set to disabled, backward frame discard is not requested

      Packet-wise functions increase the 'goodput' of the link. The 
      receive packet-wise function is Partial Packet Discard (PPD). 
      
      PPD allows the connection to discard the remainder of a cell-

      for example due to UPC. All cells are discarded up to but not

      PPD is available at all VCC connection points where UPC may be

      On CQC-based ATM FPs, packet-wise discards should only be

      sameAsCa or abrSwitch. If abrSwitch is selected, EFCI marking 
      behavior is implemented.
      
      sameAsCa is used to request the default behavior as specified in the 
      CA Abr component for this Vcc. Otherwise, this attribute overrides 
      the default behavior. 
      
      virtualSourceDest is used to request that this connection point 
      function as a virtual source/virtual destination. VS/VD functionality 
      is only supported on ATM IP FPs.
      
      sourceDest requires that this connection point function as a S/D for 
      RM cells. S/D mode is automatically invoked at this connection 
      point either if this is a connection end point, or if the next hop 
      connection point is configured as nonAbrInterworking.
      
      nonAbrInterworking is used to request that this connection point 
      function as an interworking between ABR and non-ABR service 
      categories. This means that there are no RM cells on the link side of 
      this connection, and that the next hop connection point is 
      performing as an ABR sourceDest.
      
      abrSwitch is used to request ABR switch behavior for this 
      connection point. The ABR switch behavior is first, to confirm to 
      virtualSourceDest or nonAbrInterworking setting on the next hop, 
      and otherwise to implement ABR ER switch behavior. For CQC-
      based FPs, ABR switch behavior is implemented as EFCI marking."

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute is a vector of five traffic parameters whose meanings 
      are defined by the txTrafficDescType attribute. 
      
      The values of peak cell rate (PCR), sustained cell rate (SCR), 
      Minimum Cell Rate (MCR) and requested shaping rate are 
      expressed in cell/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in 
      cells. CDVT is expressed in microseconds. The values of PCR, 
      SCR, MCR, MBS and CDVT are used for connection admission 
      control (CAC). The value of CDVT is only used for connections 
      where the atmServiceCategory is constantBitRate. For all other 
      values of atmServiceCategory, CDVT is ignored. The values of 
      PCR, SCR, MCR and requested shaping rate are used to determine 
      the actual shaping rate where traffic shaping is enabled.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, all of the parameters must be set 
      to zero.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and 
      parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value 
      in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is 
      used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be non-zero. Parameters 2 and 3 
      must be zero.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic with cell discard; parameter 2 
      represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 
      represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested 
      shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in 
      parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be 
      greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameters 1 and 2 must be 
      non-zero. Parameter 3 must be zero.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 2 
      represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 
      represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested 
      shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in 
      parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be 
      greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameters 1 and 2 must be 
      non-zero. Parameter 3 must be zero.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and 
      parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value 
      in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is 
      used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. 
      Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 
      5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 
      2.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the MBS 
      for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and 
      parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value 
      in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is 
      used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. 
      Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 
      5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 
      2.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the 
      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; 
      and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero 
      value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result 
      is used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. 
      Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 
      5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 
      2.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 9, parameter 1 represents the PCR; 
      parameter 2 represents the CDVT; parameter 3 represents the MCR; 
      parameter 4 and parameter 5 represent are not used and must be 
      zero. Parameter 1 must be non-zero and must be greater than or 
      equal to parameter 3. Parameter 3 may be optionally zero.
      
      Whenever it is valid for PCR to be specified, parameter 5 may also 
      be used to specify a requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in 
      parameter 5 overrides the value in parameter 1 and is used as the 
      peak cell rate in calculations of CAC and shaping rate. When the 
      atmServiceCategory is availableBitRate (ABR), the shaping rate is 
      dynamically chosen, based on the ABR flow control mechanism, as 
      a value between the MCR and the PCR or the requested shaping 
      rate if applicable.
      
      For txTrafficDescType 3, 4 and 5, the transmit traffic is shaped at 
      the next available shaping rate less than the PCR. 
      
      For txTrafficDescType 6, 7 and 8 if linear traffic shaping is selected, 
      the transmit traffic is shaped at the highest available rate which is 
      between PCR and SCR. However, if there is no available shaping 
      rate between PCR and SCR, traffic is shaped at the next rate above 
      the PCR. 
      
      For txTrafficDescType 6, 7 and 8 if inverse-UPC traffic shaping is 
      selected, the transmit traffic is shaped at a variable rate which 
      conforms to the PCR, SCR and MBS of the connection traffic 
      descriptor. Inverse-UPC traffic shaping is available only on ATM IP 
      cards."

     "This attribute is a vector of four traffic parameters whose meanings 
      are defined by the rxTrafficDescType attribute. The values of peak 
      cell rate (PCR), sustained cell rate (SCR) and Minimum Cell Rate 
      (MCR) are expressed in cell/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is 
      expressed in cells. The value of CDVT is expressed in 
      microseconds. The values of PCR, SCR, MCR, MBS and CDVT 
      are used for usage parameter control (UPC).
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, all of the parameters must be set 
      to zero (unused).
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic. Parameter 1 must be non-zero. 
      Parameters 2 and 3 must be set to zero (unused).
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR 
      for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard. Parameters 1 and 2 must be 
      non-zero. Parameter 3 must be set to zero (unused). Parameter 1 
      must be greater than or equal to parameter 2.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for

      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging. Parameters 1 and 2 must be 
      non-zero. Parameter 3 must be set to zero (unused). Parameter 1 
      must be greater than or equal to parameter 2.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is a 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-
      zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to Parameter 2. 
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the 
      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-
      zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. 
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the 
      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic. Parameter 1, 2 and 3 must be non-
      zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 9, parameter 1 represents the PCR; 
      parameter 2 represents the CDVT; parameter 3 represents the MCR. 
      Parameter 4 is not used and must be zero. Parameter 1,must be non-
      zero and must be greater than or equal to parameter 3. Parameter 3 
      may optionally be zero.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is any value from 3 through 8, parameter 
      4 represents the CDVT. 
      
      If the value of CDVT either in parameter 2 or in parameter 4 is zero, 
      the CDVT is taken from the CA defaults for the particular 
      atmServiceCategory of this connection.
      
      On a CQC-based ATM card, when rxTrafficDescriptorType is 3 
      through 8, there are certain extreme combinations of 
      rxTrafficDescParm which are outside the capabilities of the UPC 
      hardware. The check prov command detects such cases and 
      generates an error message. If this happens, adjust the parameters 
      until they fall within the supported limits. 
      
      To calculate the limits, use the following formulae:
      I1 = 1 000 000 000 / PCR
      L1 = CDVT * 1000
      I2 = 1,000,000,000 / SCR
      L2 = CDVT + (MBS - 1) * (I2 - I1)
      I1 and I2 must be less than or equal to 335,523,840. I1 + L1 must 
      be less than or equal to 1,342,156,800. I2 + L2 must be less than or 
      equal to 1,342,156,800. Note that I2 and L2 only apply when the 
      rxTrafficDescriptorType is 6 through 8.
      
      If the values of I1, L1, I2 or L2 are closer to the limits described 
      above, a further restriction applies. Specifically, if either:
      I1 > 41,940,480 or
      I2 > 41,940,480 or
      I1 + L1 > 167,769,600 or
      I2 + L2 > 167,769,600
      then both I1 and I2 must be greater than 20,480. 
      
      Parameter 5 of the rxTrafficDescParm is always unused. 
      
      If the rxTrafficDescType is sameAsTx, the values provisioned in 
      this attribute are ignored. The traffic parameters for the receive 
      direction are taken from the txTrafficDescParm."

-- AtmIf/n Vcc/vpi.vci Test
-- The Test component allows test traffic to be sent over an ATM

-- by non-ATM port and line tests. The Test component requires 
-- exclusive use of its parent Vcc and cannot co-exist with other ATM 
-- service components (such as Nep, Nrp, and Loop).
-- 
-- An ATM connection test circulates traffic through a VCC having a 
-- Test component at one end and the other end configured to loop 
-- back ATM cells. The Test component generates test frames, 
-- transforms them into ATM cells using AAL5 segmentation, and 
-- transmits them through the VCC; the returned cells are received by 
-- the Test component, reassembled back into frames, and the frames 
-- are consumed.
-- 
-- The test frames generated by the test are grouped into two 
-- independent streams.
-- 1) The loading frame stream circulates a set of "loading frames" 
-- through the connection as rapidly as possible. The intent of this 
-- stream is to verify the operation of the connection under a 
-- controlled load.
-- 2) The verification stream transmits a series of "verification frames" 
-- through the connection; as each frame is returned, the Test 
-- component verifies its contents and the next verification frame in 
-- the series is transmitted. The intent of this stream is to verify that 
-- frames are not being corrupted.
-- The test can be configured to send frames from either or both 
-- streams. The size and content of the test frames can also be 
-- controlled.

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute indicates the ATM service category used for traffic in 
      both directions of the connection. 
      
      The constantBitRate service category is intended for real time 
      applications, that is, those requiring tightly constrained delay and 
      delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video 
      applications. The consistent availability of a fixed quantity of 
      bandwidth is considered appropriate for CBR service. Cells which 
      are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are 
      assumed to have significantly reduced value for the application.
      
      The rtVariableBitRate service category is intended for real time 
      applications; that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and 
      delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video 
      applications. Sources are expected to transmit at a rate which varies 
      with time. Equivalently, the source can be described as 'bursty'. 
      Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer 
      Delay are assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the 
      application. Real time VBR service may support statistical 
      multiplexing of real time sources.
      
      The nrtVariableBitRate service category is intended for non-real 
      time applications which have bursty traffic characteristics and which 
      can be characterized in terms of a PCR, SCR, and MBS. For those 
      cells which are transferred within the traffic contract, the application 
      expects a low cell loss ratio. For all connections, it expects a bound 
      on the mean cell transfer delay. Non-real time VBR service may 
      support statistical multiplexing of connections.
      
      The availableBitRate service is an ATM layer service category for 
      which the limiting ATM layer transfer characteristics provided by 
      the network may change subsequent to connection establishment. 
      ABR service has a flow control mechanism which supports several 
      types of feedback to control the source rate in response to changing 
      ATM layer transfer characteristics. ABR service is not intended to 
      support real-time applications.
      
      The unspecifiedBitRate service is intended for non-real time 
      applications, that is those not requiring tightly constrained delay 
      and delay variation. UBR sources are expected to be bursty. UBR 
      service supports a high degree of statistical multiplexing among 
      sources. UBR service does not specify traffic related service 
      guarantees. No numerical commitments are made with respect to 
      the cell loss ratio experienced by a UBR connection, or as to the 
      cell transfer delay experienced by cells on the connection."

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute indicates the traffic shaping state of the connection.
      
      A value of notApplicable indicates that traffic shaping is not 
      applicable or not supported for this connection. This is the case:
      - when the txTrafficDescType is 1 or 2.
      - for standard Vpt Vccs and basic Vpts.
      - for CQC-based ATM cards, when the atmServiceCategory is 
      constantBitRate.
      
      In these cases, the value of notApplicable is set regardless of 
      whether traffic shaping is enabled or disabled in the provisioning 
      data.
      
      For the 1pOC12SmLrAtm card, traffic shaping is not available, 
      therefore this attribute is always notApplicable.
      
      A value of disabled indicates that traffic shaping is applicable and 
      supported for the type of connection but has been turned off in the 
      provisioning data.
      
      A value of linear or inverseUpc indicates that traffic shaping is 
      applicable and supported for the type of connection and has been 
      turned on in the provisioning data. This is the only case that 
      indicates that traffic shaping is performed on the connection. In this 
      case, the actual shaping rate is reflected in the txTrafficDescParm 
      attribute, parameter number 4. A value of linear indicates that 
      traffic is being shaped at the constant rate indicated in 
      txTrafficDescParm 4.
      
      A value of inverseUpc is possible only on ATM IP cards. This value 
      indicates that the shaper strictly conforms to the requirements of a 
      dual leaky bucket UPC enforcer. This value is indicated if traffic 
      shaping is enabled, and the txTrafficDescType for this connection is 
      6, 7 or 8.
      
      Traffic shaping for connections with atmServiceCategory as 
      availableBitRate (txTrafficDescType 9) depends upon the 
      abrConnectionType attribute. If abrConnectionType is sourceDest 
      or virtualSourceDest, the value of this attribute is linear. If 
      abrConnectionType is erSwitch or efciSwitch, this attribute is 
      notApplicable."

      Traffic Descriptor Information Elements.
      
      A value of epd indicates that the Early Packet Discard (EPD) 
      function is in effect at this connection endpoint. PPD and EPD are 
      enabled by default at a connection endpoint which is performing 
      AAL5 segmentation and assembly.
      
      On ATM IP cards, all packet-wise discard functions also apply to 
      provisioned virtual path connections (VPCs). On CQC-based ATM 
      cards, packet-wise functions are not applicable for VPCs.

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute is only of importance for connections which are

      links in the IMA group fail, such that the originally requested 
      bandwidth cannot be maintained. This attribute shows whether the 
      application (for example, Trunk) running on this connection can 
      continue to operate if the bandwidth is reduced. If the bandwidth is 
      reduced, the amount by which it is reduced is displayed in the 
      bandwidthReduction attribute. 
      
      A value of yes, indicates that this connection is elastic, and the 
      bandwidth may be reduced but the connection is not released. 
      
      A value of no indicates that the bandwidth for this connection is not 
      reduced in the event of link bandwidth reduction. However, this 
      connection may be released based on its holdingPriority.
      
      Bandwidth elasticity has no effect for connections which have an

      marking mode, the Explicit Forward Congestion Indication (EFCI) 
      field in the data cell headers is used to indicate transmit queue 
      congestion. 
      
      For ATM IP cards other than 1pOC12SmLrAtm, if the displayed as 
      connectionEndPoint, this attribute has the value sourceDest. In this 
      mode, the ABR Source and Destination behavior is in effect at this 
      connection. This attribute is also sourceDest in the case where the 
      next hop connection is specified as nonAbrInterworking. The next 
      hop connection is the Vcc or Vpc identified by the nextHop attribute 
      of the Nrp or Rp component. 
      
      If the connectionPointType is not connectionEndPoint, the value of 
      this attribute depends upon the abrConnectionType provisioning 
      and the card type to which the traffic is forwarded on the backplane. 
      The default abrConnectionType is provisioned at the CA Abr 
      abrConnectionType attribute, and may be overridden for a 
      provisioned connection in the Vcd Tm abrConnectionType or Vpd 
      Tm abrConnectionType attribute. If the CA Abr abrConnectionType 
      attribute is virtualSourceDest at either one of the two connection 
      points, and if both the connection points are defined on ATM IP 
      cards, virtual source and destination behavior is applied to the 
      connection. In this instance, the attribute displays the value 
      virtualSourceDest.
      
      This attribute has the value erSwitch if ABR explicit rate 
      functionality is in effect at this connection. In this mode, the switch 
      may modify the Explicit Rate (ER) field of backward Resource 
      Management (RM) cells to indicate the status of congestion at this 
      connection point.
      
      This attribute has the value nonAbrInterworking in the case where 
      this connection point is functioning as an SPVC origin for an ABR 
      connection where the link side of this connection is configured as a 
      non-ABR ATM service category. This means that there are no RM 
      cells on the link side of this connection, and that the next hop 
      connection point is performing as an ABR sourceDest."

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute is a vector of five transmit traffic parameters whose 
      mapping is defined by the txTrafficDescType attribute. 
      
      The values of peak cell rate (PCR), sustained cell rate (SCR), 
      Minimum Cell Rate (MCR), actual cell rate (ACR), explicit rate 
      (ER), equivalent cell rate (ECR), and actual shaping rate are 
      expressed in cell/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in 
      cells. CDVT is expressed in microseconds. 
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, parameters 1 through 5 are 
      unused.
      
      In this description, PCR is the greater of either the PCR or the 
      requested shaping rate (parameter 1 or parameter 5) specified in the 
      txTrafficDescParm attribute under the Vcd Tm or Vpd Tm 
      component.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 or 1 traffic; parameters 2 and 3 are unused.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the 
      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the 
      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8, parameter 4 reflects 
      the actual shaping rate in cell/s for this connection. For CQC-based 
      ATM cards, the set of available shaping rates is based on the 
      number of interfaces doing shaping (attribute 
      perVcQueueInterfaces), and the shapingScalingFactor attribute of 
      the Arc Cqc Override component. A rate of zero (0) indicates that 
      shaping is not performed, or that the interface is down. 
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 9, parameter 1 represents the PCR; 
      parameter 2 represents the Cell Delay Variation Toleration (CDVT); 
      parameter 3 represents the Minimum Cell Rate (MCR); the meaning 
      of parameter 4 depends upon the value of the abrConnectionType 
      attribute. if abrConnectionType is sourceDest or 
      virtualSourceDest, parameter 4 represents the Allowed Cell Rate 
      (ACR); If abrConnectionType is erSwitch, parameter 4 represents 
      the Explicit Rate (ER); and if abrConnectionType is efciSwitch, 
      parameter 4 reflects the actual shaping rate in cell/s for this 
      connection.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, parameter 5 reflects 
      the equivalent cell rate in cell/s for this connection as determined by 
      the Connection Admission Control (CAC) algorithm. The 
      equivalent cell rate is useful in determining the admission 
      characteristics of this connection."

      the operational queue limit.
      
      The third element is the threshold that marks the transition from

      approximately 75 percent of the first parameter, the operational 
      queue limit.

      RIF controls the amount by which the cell transmission rate may

      on the Link Side local card.
      remoteEndNoResponse indicates no response from remote end.
      activationCollision indicates activation collision was detected. 
      Usually this is caused by both ends of the connection being 
      provisioned to request PM. Only one end should be so provisioned.
      remoteEndRejectedActivation indicates the remote end has rejected 
      an activation request. Usually this is due to the remote end reaching 
      a resource limit.
      pcrUnsupported indicates the Tx or Rx PCR was out of range 
      between 0 and 409600.
      nextHopCardUnsupported indicates the next hop card type is not

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute contains the current state of the receive side OAM cell 
      congestion for this connection. Its value reflects whether the rate of 
      received OAM cells for this connection is below a specified 
      threshold. The connection maintains a count of the number of OAM 
      cells which are terminated per second. Once that count exceeds the 
      specified threshold, extraction of all OAM cells for this connection 
      is disabled for a period of one minute. This is a congestion 
      management mechanism to prevent the processor from being 
      overloaded with handling OAM cells for a particular connection. 
      This mechanism ensures that tasks, such as trunks obtain enough 
      processor cycles to remain in service, and are not adversely affected 
      by excessive rate of OAM cells on a particular connection.
      
      The value is good when the rate of received OAM cells is less than 
      the allowed threshold.
      
      The value is bad when the arrival rate has exceeded the allowed 
      threshold. It remains bad for one minute, before returning to good 
      again. During this timeout, extraction of all OAM cells is disabled 
      for this connection. As a result, other loopback failure conditions 
      may occur.
      
      The value is unknown when the application has not yet begun to 
      use this connection. An example is the Test component before a test 
      has been started.
      
      Each type of OAM cell is counted separately. The threshold for AIS 
      cells is three cells per second. If more than three AIS cells are 
      received within a one second interval, this attribute is set to bad. 
      The threshold for RDI cells and each loopback type is also three, 
      but the threshold for trace cells is 250 per second.
      
      The state of this attribute has no direct effect on the value of the 
      operStatus attribute or on the number of troubled connections."

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute is HISTORICAL. Please refer to the attribute of the 
      same name in the group AtmTmOper.
      
      This attribute indicates the ATM service category used for traffic in 
      both directions of the connection. 
      
      The constantBitRate service category is intended for real time 
      applications, that is, those requiring tightly constrained delay and 
      delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video 
      applications. The consistent availability of a fixed quantity of 
      bandwidth is considered appropriate for CBR service. Cells which 
      are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are 
      assumed to have significantly reduced value of the application.
      
      The rtVariableBitRate service category is intended for real time 
      applications; that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and 
      delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video 
      applications. Sources are expected to transmit at a rate which varies 
      with time. Equivalently, the source can be described as 'bursty'. 
      Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer 
      Delay are assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the 
      application. Real time VBR service may support statistical 
      multiplexing of real time sources.
      
      The nrtVariableBitRate service category is intended for non-real 
      time applications which have bursty traffic characteristics and which 
      can be characterized in terms of a PCR, SCR, and MBS. For those 
      cells which are transferred within the traffic contract, the application 
      expects a low cell loss ratio. For all connections, it expects a bound 
      on the mean cell transfer delay. Non-real time VBR service may 
      support statistical multiplexing of connections.
      
      The unspecifiedBitRate service is intended for non-real time 
      applications, that is those not requiring tightly constrained delay 
      and delay variation. UBR sources are expected to be bursty. UBR 
      service supports a high degree of statistical multiplexing among 
      sources. UBR service does not specify traffic related service 
      guarantees. No numerical commitments are made with respect to 
      the cell loss ratio experienced by a UBR connection, or as to the 
      cell transfer delay experienced by cells on the connection."

      This attribute indicates the bearer capability for this connection.
      
      Class a service is a connection-oriented, constant bit rate ATM 
      transport service. Class a service has end to end timing 
      requirements and may require stringent cell loss, cell delay and cell 
      delay variation performance.When a is displayed, the user is

      Class x service is a connection-oriented ATM transport service 
      where the AAL, trafficType (cbr or vbr) and timing requirements 
      are user defined (that is, transparent to the network). When the 
      value of this attribute is x, the user is requesting an ATM only 
      service from the network. In this case, the network shall not process

      Class vp service is used to indicate a transparent VP service when 
      the user is requesting an ATM only service from the network. In this 
      case, the network does not process any higher layer protocol. This 
      service differs from class x service in that with the class vp service 
      both the VCI field (except for VCI values 0, 3, 4, and 6 through 15)

      This attribute counts the number of cells or frames received from

      If the connection segments frames into cells, the counter indicates 
      the number of frames discarded. Connections which segment 
      frames into cells have a connectionPointType of

      If the connection relays cells without adaptation, the counter

      cells without adaptation have a connectionPointType of 
      segmentEndPoint or connectingPoint.
      
      AAL1 connections are an exception to this rule; although they have

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute is HISTORICAL. Please refer to the attribute of the 
      same name in the group AtmTmOper.
      
      This attribute is a vector of five transmit traffic parameters. The first 
      three elements reflect the settings of the first three elements of the 
      txTrafficDescParm attribute in the AtmTrafficProv group. 
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, parameters 1 through 5 are 
      unused.
      
      In this description, PCR is the greater of either the PCR or the 
      requested shaping rate (parameter 1 or parameter 5) specified in the 
      Traffic group under the Vcd or Vpd.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 or 1 traffic; parameters 2 and 3 are unused.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the 
      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the 
      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8, parameter 4 reflects 
      the actual shaping rate in cell/s for this connection. This rate is one 
      of the set of available shaping rates for this type of ATM-FP, based 
      on the number of interfaces doing shaping (attribute 
      perVcQueueInterfaces), the provisioned cell rate, the 
      shapingScalingFactor attribute of the AtmResourceControl 
      component, and whether traffic shaping is enabled. A rate of zero 
      (0) indicates that shaping is not performed. 
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8, parameter 5 reflects 
      the equivalent cell rate in cell/s for this connection as determined by 
      the Connection Admission Control (CAC) algorithm. The 
      equivalent cell rate is useful in determining the admission 
      characteristics of this connection."

      This attribute is a vector of four traffic parameters whose meanings 
      are defined by the rxTrafficDescType attribute. The values of peak 
      cell rate (PCR), sustained cell rate (SCR) are expressed in cells/s. 
      Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in cells. Cell Delay 
      Variation Tolerance (CDVT) is expressed in microseconds.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, none of the parameters are used.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard; parameter 4 represents the 
      CDVT.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 4 represents the 
      CDVT.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is a 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT. 
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the 
      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for

      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT. 
      
      If Upc is disabled for this connection, the values of PCR, SCR, 
      MBS and CDVT is a combination of provisioned parameters. If Upc 
      is enabled, the values of PCR, SCR, MBS, and CDVT is exactly the 
      values used by the usage parameter control hardware in policing the 
      arriving traffic. These may vary slightly from the provisioned values 
      due to granularity of the hardware. In the case where the PCR is 
      equal to the SCR, the effective MBS is zero."

      This attribute indicates the queue limit and the discard thresholds 
      for the transmit queue of this connection. 
      
      The first element indicates the queue limit. Depending upon the 
      atmServiceCategory of the connection, the provisioned value of the 
      transmit queue limit is derived from the txQueueLimit attribute 
      under one of the subcomponents of the AtmIf CA component. If the 
      connection has traffic shaping disabled, then this attribute relates to 
      the common queue. If traffic shaping is enabled, then this attribute 
      relates to the per-VC queue.
      
      The second element is the threshold that marks the transition from 
      congestion state 1 to congestion state 0. This is the threshold at 
      which traffic with discard priority (DP) = 1 is discarded. This 
      threshold is set approximately at 90 percent of the first parameter, 
      the operational queue limit.
      
      The third element is the threshold that marks the transition from 
      congestion state 2 to congestion state 1. This is the threshold at 
      which traffic with DP = 2 is discarded. This threshold is set 
      approximately at 75 percent of the first parameter, the operational 
      queue limit.
      
      The fourth element is the threshold that marks the transition from 
      congestion state 3 to congestion state 2. This is the threshold at 
      which traffic with DP = 3 is discarded. This threshold is set 
      approximately at 35 percent of the first parameter, the operational

      This attribute specifies the ATM service category for both directions

      The value derivedFromBBC may only be used if the SrcPvc 
      component is provisioned under this Vcc.Otherwise a specific ATM 
      service category must be specified. 
      
      If this attribute is set to derivedFromBBC, the Broadband Bearer 
      Capability (BBC) and bestEffort attributes are used to determine the 
      atmServiceCategory of this connection. 
      
      If this attribute is set to other than derivedFromBBC, the value of 
      this attribute is used to override the provisioned BBC Information 
      Element parameters. In those cases, the BBC attributes are not used. 
      
      The constantBitRate service category is intended for real time 
      applications, that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and 
      delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video 
      applications. The consistent availability of a fixed quantity of 
      bandwidth is considered appropriate for CBR service. Cells which 
      are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are 
      assumed to be of significantly reduce value to the application.
      
      The rtVariableBitRate service category is intended for real time 
      applications, that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and 
      delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video 
      applications. Sources are expected to transmit at a rate which varies 
      with time. Equivalently, the source can be described as 'bursty'. 
      Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by CTD are 
      assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the application. Real 
      time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of real time 
      sources.
      
      The nrtVariableBitRate service category is intended for non-real 
      time applications which have bursty traffic characteristics and which 
      can be characterized in terms of a PCR, SCR, and MBS. For those 
      cells which are transferred within the traffic contract, the application 
      expects a low cell loss ratio. For all connections, it expects a bound 
      on the mean cell transfer delay. Non-real time VBR service may 
      support statistical multiplexing of connections.
      
      The unspecifiedBitRate service is intended for non-real time 
      applications; that is, those not requiring tightly constrained delay 
      and delay variation. UBR sources are expected to be bursty. UBR 
      service supports a high degree of statistical multiplexing among 
      sources. UBR service does not specify traffic related service 
      guarantees. No numerical commitments are made with respect to 
      the cell loss ratio experienced by a UBR connection, or as to the 
      cell transfer delay experienced by cells on the connection."

      This attribute specifies the bearer capability. This attribute is only 
      used for SPVC and SPVP connections. It is one of the Broadband 
      Bearer Capability (BBC) attributes. The purpose of the BBC 
      information element is to indicate a requested broadband 
      connection-oriented bearer service to be provided by the network.
      
      The value derivedFromServiceCategory specifies that the actual 
      value which is used for this connection is derived from the value of 
      the atmServiceCategory. Either, this attribute must be set to 
      derivedFromServiceCategory, or the atmServiceCategory attribute 
      must be set to derivedFromBBC, but not both.
      
      Class a service is a connection-oriented, constant bit rate ATM 
      transport service. Class a service has end to end timing 
      requirements and may require stringent cell loss, cell delay and cell 
      delay variation performance.When a is set, the user is requesting 
      more than an ATM only service. The network may look at the AAL 
      to provide interworking based upon its contents. 
      
      Class c service is a connection-oriented, variable bit rate ATM 
      transport service. Class c service has no end-to-end timing 
      requirements. When c is set, the user is requesting more than an 
      ATM only service. The network interworking function may look at 
      the AAL and provide service based on it.
      
      Class x service is a connection-oriented ATM transport service 
      where the AAL, trafficType (vbr or cbr) and timing requirements 
      are user defined (that is, transparent to the network).When x is set 
      the user is requesting an ATM only service from the network.
      
      Class vp service is used to specify a transparent VP service. When 
      the value of this attribute is vp, the user is requesting an ATM only 
      service from the network. In this case, the network shall not process 
      any higher layer protocol. This service differs from class x service 
      in that with the class vp service both the VCI field (except or VCI 
      values 0, 3, 4, and 6 through 15) and Payload Type field are 
      transported transparently by the network. This attribute value is 
      only applicable to SPVP connections."

      are expressed in cell/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in 
      cells. CDVT is expressed in microseconds. The values of PCR, 
      SCR, MBS and CDVT are used for connection admission control 
      (CAC). The value of CDVT is only used for connections where the 
      atmServiceCategory is constantBitRate. For all other values of 
      atmServiceCategory, CDVT is ignored. The values of PCR, SCR 
      and requested shaping rate are used to determine the actual shaping

      parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be 
      greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameters 1 and 2 must be 
      non-zero. Parameter 3 must be zero.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 2 
      represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 
      represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested 
      shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in 
      parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be

      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and 
      parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value

      5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 
      2.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for

      CLP equal to 0 with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the MBS 
      for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and 
      parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value 
      in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is 
      used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. 
      Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 
      5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 
      2.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the 
      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; 
      and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero 
      value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result 
      is used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. 
      Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 
      5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 
      2.
      
      Whenever it is valid for PCR to be specified, parameter 5 may also 
      be used to specify a requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in 
      parameter 5 overrides the value in parameter 1 and is used as the 
      peak cell rate in calculations of CAC and shaping rate.
      
      For txTrafficDescType 3, 4 and 5, the transmit traffic is shaped at 
      the next rate less than the PCR. 
      
      For txTrafficDescType 6, 7 and 8, the transmit traffic is shaped at 
      the highest available rate which is between PCR and SCR. 
      However, if there is no available shaping rate between PCR and 
      SCR, traffic is shaped at the next rate above the PCR."

      cell rate (PCR) and sustained cell rate (SCR) are expressed in 
      cell/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in cells. The value 
      of CDVT is expressed in microseconds. The values of PCR, SCR, 
      MBS and CDVT are used for usage parameter control (UPC).
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, all of the parameters must be set 
      to zero (unused).
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic. Parameter 1 must be non-zero. 
      Parameters 2 and 3 must be set to zero (unused).
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard. Parameters 1 and 2 must be 
      non-zero. Parameter 3 must be set to zero (unused). Parameter 1 
      must be greater than or equal to parameter 2.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging. Parameters 1 and 2 must be 
      non-zero. Parameter 3 must be set to zero (unused). Parameter 1 
      must be greater than or equal to parameter 2.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is a 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-
      zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to Parameter 2. 
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the 
      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-
      zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. 
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the 
      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic. Parameter 1, 2 and 3 must be non-
      zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is any value from 3 through 8, parameter 
      4 represents the CDVT. If this value is zero, the CDVT is taken 
      from the ConnectionAdministrator defaults for the particular 
      atmServiceCategory of this connection.
      
      When rxTrafficDescriptorType is 3 through 8, there are certain 
      extreme combinations of rxTrafficDescParm which are outside the 
      capabilities of the UPC hardware. The check prov command detects 
      such cases and generates an error message. If this happens, adjust 
      the parameters until they fall within the supported limits. 
      
      To calculate the limits, use the following formulae:
      I1 = 1 000 000 000 / PCR
      L1 = CDVT * 1000
      I2 = 1 000 000 000 / SCR
      L2 = CDVT + (MBS - 1) * (I2 - I1)
      I1 and I2 must be less than or equal to 335 523 840. I1 + L1 must 
      be less than or equal to 1 342 156 800. I2 + L2 must be less than or 
      equal to 1 342 156 800. Note that I2 and L2 only apply when the 
      rxTrafficDescriptorType is 6 through 8.
      
      If the values of I1, L1, I2 or L2 are closer to the limits described 
      above, a further restriction applies. Specifically, if either:
      I1 > 41 940 480 or
      I2 > 41 940 480 or
      I1 + L1 > 167 769 600 or
      I2 + L2 > 167 769 600
      then both I1 and I2 must be greater than 20 480. 
      
      Parameter 5 of the rxTrafficDescParm is always unused. 
      
      If the rxTrafficDescType is sameAsTx, the values in this attribute 
      are taken from the txTrafficDescParm."

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute specifies the ATM service category for both directions 
      of the connection. 
      
      The value derivedFromBBC may only be used if the SrcPvc 
      component is provisioned under this Vcc. Otherwise a specific 
      ATM service category must be specified. 
      
      If this attribute is set to derivedFromBBC, the Broadband Bearer 
      Capability (BBC) and bestEffort attributes are used to determine the 
      atmServiceCategory of this connection. 
      
      If this attribute is set to other than derivedFromBBC, the value of 
      this attribute is used to override the provisioned BBC Information 
      Element parameters. In those cases, the BBC attributes are not used. 
      
      The constantBitRate service category is intended for real time 
      applications, that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and 
      delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video 
      applications. The consistent availability of a fixed quantity of 
      bandwidth is considered appropriate for CBR service. Cells which 
      are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are 
      assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the application.
      
      The rtVariableBitRate service category is intended for real time 
      applications, that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and 
      delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video 
      applications. Sources are expected to transmit at a rate which varies 
      with time. Equivalently, the source can be described as 'bursty'. 
      Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by CTD are 
      assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the application. Real 
      time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of real time 
      sources.
      
      The nrtVariableBitRate service category is intended for non-real 
      time applications which have bursty traffic characteristics and which 
      can be characterized in terms of a PCR, SCR, and MBS. For those 
      cells which are transferred within the traffic contract, the application 
      expects a low cell loss ratio. For all connections, it expects a bound 
      on the mean cell transfer delay. Non-real time VBR service may 
      support statistical multiplexing of connections. 
      
      The availableBitRate service is an ATM layer service category for 
      which the limiting ATM layer transfer characteristics provided by 
      the network may change subsequent to connection establishment. 
      ABR service has a flow control mechanism which supports several 
      types of feedback to control the source rate in response to changing 
      ATM layer transfer characteristics. ABR service is not intended to 
      support real-time applications. 
      
      The unspecifiedBitRate service is intended for non-real time 
      applications; that is, those not requiring tightly constrained delay 
      and delay variation. UBR sources are expected to be bursty. UBR 
      service supports a high degree of statistical multiplexing among 
      sources. UBR service does not specify traffic related service 
      guarantees. No numerical commitments are made with respect to 
      the cell loss ratio experienced by a UBR connection, or as to the 
      cell transfer delay experienced by cells on the connection."

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute specifies whether packet-wise discard functions are to 
      be enabled or disabled in the transmit data direction for this 
      connection. Packet-wise discard functions should only be requested 
      if this connection is transferring AAL5 frame traffic. This attribute 
      is not applicable for Vpts.
      
      Packet-wise functions increase the 'goodput' of the link. The 
      transmit packet-wise functions are Early Packet Discard (EPD) and 
      Partial Packet Discard (PPD). 
      
      EPD allows the connection to discard an entire frame once the 
      transmit queue has reached the EPD threshold. EPD increases the 
      'goodput' of a link, since discarding an entire frame means that 
      some queue capacity is guarded for some other frame which is 
      already partially transmitted. All cells of the frame are discarded 
      from the Beginning of Message (BOM) cell up to and including the 
      End of Message (EOM) cell. 
      
      PPD allows the connection to discard the remainder of a cell-
      forwarded AAL5 frame if one cell of this frame has been discarded. 
      All cells are discarded up to but not including the EOM cell. The 
      PPD function increases the 'goodput' of the link, since cells which 
      are only going to be discarded at the AAL5 reassembly point are 
      not transmitted.
      
      On CQC-based ATM cards, the packet-wise discard functions are 
      PPD and EPD. PPD is available at VCC cell-transfer points. PPD is 
      not applicable at frame-cell conversion points, and is not applicable 
      for Vpcs. PPD is configured by this attribute. Packet-wise discard 
      should only be enabled for connections carrying AAL5 
      segmentation traffic. Setting the value to enabled for any other 
      traffic type may result in all traffic being discarded. On CQC-based 
      ATM FPs, EPD is automatically enabled at frame-to-cell conversion 
      points, independent of the setting of this attribute. 
      
      On CQC-based ATM cards, at a permanent VCC connection 
      endpoint, this attribute is not applicable and is ignored. If AAL5 
      segmentation and reassembly has been requested, PPD and Early 
      Packet Discard (EPD) are automatically enabled.
      
      On ATM IP cards, packet-wise discard functions include EPD and 
      PPD. PPD and EPD apply to individual VCCs and VCCs within 
      VPCs at all connection points, including tandem VPC connections. 
      Both PPD and EPD are controlled by this attribute. This attribute 
      may safely be set to enabled for any connection (Vcc or Vpc) on 
      ATM IP FPs since they have the ability to automatically detect 
      AAL5-segmented traffic on a connection, and only enable packet-
      wise discards if AAL5-segmented traffic is detected.
      
      When this attribute is set to enabled, packet-wise discard functions

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute specifies whether packet-wise discard functions are to 
      be enabled or disabled in the receive data direction for this 
      connection. Packet-wise discard functions should only be requested 
      if this connection is transferring AAL5 frame traffic. This attribute 
      is not applicable for Vpts.
      
      Packet-wise functions increase the 'goodput' of the link. The 
      receive packet-wise function is Partial Packet Discard (PPD). 
      
      PPD allows the connection to discard the remainder of a cell-
      forwarded AAL5 frame if one cell of this frame has been discarded, 
      for example due to UPC. All cells are discarded up to but not 
      including the EOM cell. The PPD function increases the 'goodput' 
      of the link, since cells which are only going to be discarded at the 
      AAL5 reassembly point are not transmitted.
      
      PPD is available at all VCC connection points where UPC may be 
      activated. PPD is not applicable for Vpcs. 
      
      On CQC-based ATM FPs, packet-wise discards should only be 
      enabled for connections carrying AAL5 segmentation traffic. 
      Setting the value to enabled for any other traffic type may result in 
      traffic being discarded. 
      
      On CQC-based ATM cards, at a permanent VCC connection 
      endpoint, this attribute is not applicable and is ignored. If AAL5 
      segmentation and reassembly has been requested, PPD and Early 
      Packet Discard (EPD) are automatically enabled.
      
      On ATM IP cards, this attribute may safely be set to enabled for any 
      connection (Vcc or Vpc) since they have the ability to automatically 
      detect AAL5-segmented traffic on a connection, and only enables 
      packet-wise discards if AAL5-segmented traffic is detected.
      
      When this attribute is set to enabled, packet-wise discard functions 
      are applied to receive traffic at this connection point. When this 
      attribute is set to disabled, packet-wise discard functions are not 
      applied to receive traffic at this connection point.
      
      At a SPVC origin on a PNNI interface, a value of enabled specifies 
      that frame discard is requested in the forward direction. When this

      the SPVC call setup. 
      
      The receive packet-wise discard functions that are active are visible

     "This attribute specifies the type of ABR behavior which is to be

      atmServicecategory attribute is not availableBitRate, this attribute

      The actual ABR functionality which is in effect is visible in the

      For CQC-based ATM cards, the only allowable values are 
      sameAsCa, nonAbrInterworking or abrSwitch. If abrSwitch is 
      selected, the CQC implements EFCI marking behavior.
      
      For the 1pOC12SmLrAtm card, the only allowable values are 
      sameAsCa or abrSwitch. If abrSwitch is selected, EFCI marking 
      behavior is implemented.
      
      sameAsCa is used to request the default behavior as specified in the 
      CA Abr component for this Vcc. Otherwise, this attribute overrides 
      the default behavior. 
      
      virtualSourceDest is used to request that this connection point 
      function as a virtual source/virtual destination. VS/VD functionality 
      is only supported on ATM IP FPs.
      
      sourceDest requires that this connection point function as a S/D for 
      RM cells. S/D mode is automatically invoked at this connection 
      point either if this is a connection end point, or if the next hop 
      connection point is configured as nonAbrInterworking.
      
      nonAbrInterworking is used to request that this connection point 
      function as an interworking between ABR and non-ABR service 
      categories. This means that there are no RM cells on the link side of 
      this connection, and that the next hop connection point is 
      performing as an ABR sourceDest.
      
      abrSwitch is used to request ABR switch behavior for this 
      connection point. The ABR switch behavior is first, to confirm to 
      virtualSourceDest or nonAbrInterworking setting on the next hop, 
      and otherwise to implement ABR ER switch behavior. For CQC-
      based FPs, ABR switch behavior is implemented as EFCI marking."

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute is a vector of five traffic parameters whose meanings 
      are defined by the txTrafficDescType attribute. 
      
      The values of peak cell rate (PCR), sustained cell rate (SCR), 
      Minimum Cell Rate (MCR) and requested shaping rate are 
      expressed in cell/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in 
      cells. CDVT is expressed in microseconds. The values of PCR, 
      SCR, MCR, MBS and CDVT are used for connection admission 
      control (CAC). The value of CDVT is only used for connections 
      where the atmServiceCategory is constantBitRate. For all other 
      values of atmServiceCategory, CDVT is ignored. The values of 
      PCR, SCR, MCR and requested shaping rate are used to determine 
      the actual shaping rate where traffic shaping is enabled.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, all of the parameters must be set 
      to zero.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and 
      parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value 
      in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is 
      used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be non-zero. Parameters 2 and 3 
      must be zero.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic with cell discard; parameter 2 
      represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 
      represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested 
      shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in 
      parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be 
      greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameters 1 and 2 must be 
      non-zero. Parameter 3 must be zero.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 2 
      represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 
      represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested 
      shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in 
      parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be 
      greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameters 1 and 2 must be 
      non-zero. Parameter 3 must be zero.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and 
      parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value 
      in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is 
      used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. 
      Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 
      5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 
      2.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the MBS 
      for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and 
      parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value 
      in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is 
      used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. 
      Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 
      5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 
      2.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the 
      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; 
      and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero 
      value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result 
      is used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. 
      Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 
      5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 
      2.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 9, parameter 1 represents the PCR; 
      parameter 2 represents the CDVT; parameter 3 represents the MCR; 
      parameter 4 and parameter 5 represent are not used and must be 
      zero. Parameter 1 must be non-zero and must be greater than or 
      equal to parameter 3. Parameter 3 may be optionally zero.
      
      Whenever it is valid for PCR to be specified, parameter 5 may also 
      be used to specify a requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in 
      parameter 5 overrides the value in parameter 1 and is used as the 
      peak cell rate in calculations of CAC and shaping rate. When the 
      atmServiceCategory is availableBitRate (ABR), the shaping rate is 
      dynamically chosen, based on the ABR flow control mechanism, as 
      a value between the MCR and the PCR or the requested shaping 
      rate if applicable.
      
      For txTrafficDescType 3, 4 and 5, the transmit traffic is shaped at 
      the next available shaping rate less than the PCR. 
      
      For txTrafficDescType 6, 7 and 8 if linear traffic shaping is selected, 
      the transmit traffic is shaped at the highest available rate which is 
      between PCR and SCR. However, if there is no available shaping 
      rate between PCR and SCR, traffic is shaped at the next rate above 
      the PCR. 
      
      For txTrafficDescType 6, 7 and 8 if inverse-UPC traffic shaping is 
      selected, the transmit traffic is shaped at a variable rate which 
      conforms to the PCR, SCR and MBS of the connection traffic 
      descriptor. Inverse-UPC traffic shaping is available only on ATM IP 
      cards."

     "This attribute is a vector of four traffic parameters whose meanings 
      are defined by the rxTrafficDescType attribute. The values of peak 
      cell rate (PCR), sustained cell rate (SCR) and Minimum Cell Rate 
      (MCR) are expressed in cell/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is 
      expressed in cells. The value of CDVT is expressed in 
      microseconds. The values of PCR, SCR, MCR, MBS and CDVT 
      are used for usage parameter control (UPC).
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, all of the parameters must be set 
      to zero (unused).
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic. Parameter 1 must be non-zero. 
      Parameters 2 and 3 must be set to zero (unused).
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR 
      for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard. Parameters 1 and 2 must be 
      non-zero. Parameter 3 must be set to zero (unused). Parameter 1 
      must be greater than or equal to parameter 2.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for

      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging. Parameters 1 and 2 must be 
      non-zero. Parameter 3 must be set to zero (unused). Parameter 1 
      must be greater than or equal to parameter 2.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is a 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-
      zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to Parameter 2. 
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the 
      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-
      zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. 
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the 
      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic. Parameter 1, 2 and 3 must be non-
      zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 9, parameter 1 represents the PCR; 
      parameter 2 represents the CDVT; parameter 3 represents the MCR. 
      Parameter 4 is not used and must be zero. Parameter 1,must be non-
      zero and must be greater than or equal to parameter 3. Parameter 3 
      may optionally be zero.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is any value from 3 through 8, parameter 
      4 represents the CDVT. 
      
      If the value of CDVT either in parameter 2 or in parameter 4 is zero, 
      the CDVT is taken from the CA defaults for the particular 
      atmServiceCategory of this connection.
      
      On a CQC-based ATM card, when rxTrafficDescriptorType is 3 
      through 8, there are certain extreme combinations of 
      rxTrafficDescParm which are outside the capabilities of the UPC 
      hardware. The check prov command detects such cases and 
      generates an error message. If this happens, adjust the parameters 
      until they fall within the supported limits. 
      
      To calculate the limits, use the following formulae:
      I1 = 1 000 000 000 / PCR
      L1 = CDVT * 1000
      I2 = 1,000,000,000 / SCR
      L2 = CDVT + (MBS - 1) * (I2 - I1)
      I1 and I2 must be less than or equal to 335,523,840. I1 + L1 must 
      be less than or equal to 1,342,156,800. I2 + L2 must be less than or 
      equal to 1,342,156,800. Note that I2 and L2 only apply when the 
      rxTrafficDescriptorType is 6 through 8.
      
      If the values of I1, L1, I2 or L2 are closer to the limits described 
      above, a further restriction applies. Specifically, if either:
      I1 > 41,940,480 or
      I2 > 41,940,480 or
      I1 + L1 > 167,769,600 or
      I2 + L2 > 167,769,600
      then both I1 and I2 must be greater than 20,480. 
      
      Parameter 5 of the rxTrafficDescParm is always unused. 
      
      If the rxTrafficDescType is sameAsTx, the values provisioned in 
      this attribute are ignored. The traffic parameters for the receive 
      direction are taken from the txTrafficDescParm."

     "This attribute specifies the tolerable cell loss ratio (CLR) for CBR

      For example, if the target CLR = 1E-10 then Cbr cellLossRatio =

      CBR and rt-VBR traffic have the same discard priority. The Cbr

      Setting this attribute to 0 means that a CLR of 1 can be tolerated. In 
      this case, no bandwidth is reserved for CBR connections, and CAC 
      is effectively turned off. All CBR connections are admitted."

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute specifies the tolerable cell loss ratio (CLR) for nrt-
      VBR traffic. The number is the negative logarithm (base 10) of the 
      CLR. In other words if the target CLR = 1E-10 then NrtVbr 
      cellLossRatio = 10. This number must be greater than or equal to 
      RtVbr cellLossRatio since rt-VBR traffic has a higher discard 
      priority. The NrtVbr cellLossRatio is used by the Connection 
      Admission Control (CAC) algorithm to compute the required 
      (equivalent) cell rate for nrt-VBR connections. 
      
      There is a trade-off between the service category CLR and the 
      achievable Vpt bandwidth utilization. To guarantee an excellent 
      service category, the CLR should be as small as possible (e.g., 1E-
      10). However, a smaller CLR results in a larger equivalent cell rate 
      for a given connection and hence a lower Vpt bandwidth utilization. 
      
      Setting this attribute to 0 means that a CLR of 1 can be tolerated. In 
      this case, no bandwidth is reserved for nrt-VBR connections, and 
      CAC is effectively turned off. All nrt-VBR connections are 
      admitted."

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute indicates the ATM service category used for traffic in 
      both directions of the connection. 
      
      The constantBitRate service category is intended for real time 
      applications, that is, those requiring tightly constrained delay and 
      delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video 
      applications. The consistent availability of a fixed quantity of 
      bandwidth is considered appropriate for CBR service. Cells which 
      are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are 
      assumed to have significantly reduced value for the application.
      
      The rtVariableBitRate service category is intended for real time 
      applications; that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and 
      delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video 
      applications. Sources are expected to transmit at a rate which varies 
      with time. Equivalently, the source can be described as 'bursty'. 
      Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer 
      Delay are assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the 
      application. Real time VBR service may support statistical 
      multiplexing of real time sources.
      
      The nrtVariableBitRate service category is intended for non-real 
      time applications which have bursty traffic characteristics and which 
      can be characterized in terms of a PCR, SCR, and MBS. For those 
      cells which are transferred within the traffic contract, the application 
      expects a low cell loss ratio. For all connections, it expects a bound 
      on the mean cell transfer delay. Non-real time VBR service may 
      support statistical multiplexing of connections.
      
      The availableBitRate service is an ATM layer service category for 
      which the limiting ATM layer transfer characteristics provided by 
      the network may change subsequent to connection establishment. 
      ABR service has a flow control mechanism which supports several 
      types of feedback to control the source rate in response to changing 
      ATM layer transfer characteristics. ABR service is not intended to 
      support real-time applications.
      
      The unspecifiedBitRate service is intended for non-real time 
      applications, that is those not requiring tightly constrained delay 
      and delay variation. UBR sources are expected to be bursty. UBR 
      service supports a high degree of statistical multiplexing among 
      sources. UBR service does not specify traffic related service 
      guarantees. No numerical commitments are made with respect to 
      the cell loss ratio experienced by a UBR connection, or as to the 
      cell transfer delay experienced by cells on the connection."

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute indicates the traffic shaping state of the connection.
      
      A value of notApplicable indicates that traffic shaping is not 
      applicable or not supported for this connection. This is the case:
      - when the txTrafficDescType is 1 or 2.
      - for standard Vpt Vccs and basic Vpts.
      - for CQC-based ATM cards, when the atmServiceCategory is 
      constantBitRate.
      
      In these cases, the value of notApplicable is set regardless of 
      whether traffic shaping is enabled or disabled in the provisioning 
      data.
      
      For the 1pOC12SmLrAtm card, traffic shaping is not available, 
      therefore this attribute is always notApplicable.
      
      A value of disabled indicates that traffic shaping is applicable and 
      supported for the type of connection but has been turned off in the 
      provisioning data.
      
      A value of linear or inverseUpc indicates that traffic shaping is 
      applicable and supported for the type of connection and has been 
      turned on in the provisioning data. This is the only case that 
      indicates that traffic shaping is performed on the connection. In this 
      case, the actual shaping rate is reflected in the txTrafficDescParm 
      attribute, parameter number 4. A value of linear indicates that 
      traffic is being shaped at the constant rate indicated in 
      txTrafficDescParm 4.
      
      A value of inverseUpc is possible only on ATM IP cards. This value 
      indicates that the shaper strictly conforms to the requirements of a 
      dual leaky bucket UPC enforcer. This value is indicated if traffic 
      shaping is enabled, and the txTrafficDescType for this connection is 
      6, 7 or 8.
      
      Traffic shaping for connections with atmServiceCategory as 
      availableBitRate (txTrafficDescType 9) depends upon the 
      abrConnectionType attribute. If abrConnectionType is sourceDest 
      or virtualSourceDest, the value of this attribute is linear. If 
      abrConnectionType is erSwitch or efciSwitch, this attribute is

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute indicates the relative weight of this unshaped 
      connection. Connections with a larger weight get a larger proportion 
      of the link bandwidth or in the case of standard Vpt Vccs, the Vpt 
      bandwidth.
      
      For all but standard Vpt Vccs, the default connection weight is 
      determined by the weight policy for a service category and the 
      traffic descriptor for a connection. For standard Vpt Vccs, the 
      default connection weight is determined by the Vcc's service 
      category.
      
      For CQC-based ATM cards, this attribute is not applicable and is 
      not displayed.
      
      A value from 1 to 4095 indicates an actual weight. The value 
      upToQueueLimit indicates that the weight of a connection is up to 
      the transmit queue limit for this connection. upToQueueLimit is 
      used with common (first-in-first-out) queueing. 
      
      This attribute is displayed as notApplicable if:
      - this connection has trafficShaping displayed as linear or 
      inverseUpc.

      attributes. 
      
      ATM IP cards provide the ability to monitor UPC violations without 
      tagging or discarding. A value of monitored indicates that UPC is 
      actively checking conformance for the connection and counting the 
      violations, but is not discarding or tagging cells which do not 
      conform to the connection traffic contract. The traffic descriptor

      For CQC-based ATM cards and the 1pOC12SmLrAtm card, the 
      notApplicable, efciSwitch or nonAbrInterworking. In EFCI 
      marking mode, the Explicit Forward Congestion Indication (EFCI) 
      field in the data cell headers is used to indicate transmit queue 
      congestion. 
      
      For ATM IP cards other than 1pOC12SmLrAtm, if the displayed as 
      connectionEndPoint, this attribute has the value sourceDest. In this 
      mode, the ABR Source and Destination behavior is in effect at this

      next hop connection is specified as nonAbrInterworking. The next 
      hop connection is the Vcc or Vpc identified by the nextHop attribute 
      of the Nrp or Rp component. 
      
      If the connectionPointType is not connectionEndPoint, the value of 
      this attribute depends upon the abrConnectionType provisioning 
      and the card type to which the traffic is forwarded on the backplane. 
      The default abrConnectionType is provisioned at the CA Abr 
      abrConnectionType attribute, and may be overridden for a 
      provisioned connection in the Vcd Tm abrConnectionType or Vpd 
      Tm abrConnectionType attribute. If the CA Abr abrConnectionType 
      attribute is virtualSourceDest at either one of the two connection 
      points, and if both the connection points are defined on ATM IP 
      cards, virtual source and destination behavior is applied to the 
      connection. In this instance, the attribute displays the value 
      virtualSourceDest.
      
      This attribute has the value erSwitch if ABR explicit rate 
      functionality is in effect at this connection. In this mode, the switch 
      may modify the Explicit Rate (ER) field of backward Resource 
      Management (RM) cells to indicate the status of congestion at this

      This attribute has the value nonAbrInterworking in the case where 
      this connection point is functioning as an SPVC origin for an ABR 
      connection where the link side of this connection is configured as a 
      non-ABR ATM service category. This means that there are no RM 
      cells on the link side of this connection, and that the next hop 
      connection point is performing as an ABR sourceDest."

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute is a vector of five transmit traffic parameters whose 
      mapping is defined by the txTrafficDescType attribute. 
      
      The values of peak cell rate (PCR), sustained cell rate (SCR), 
      Minimum Cell Rate (MCR), actual cell rate (ACR), explicit rate 
      (ER), equivalent cell rate (ECR), and actual shaping rate are 
      expressed in cell/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in 
      cells. CDVT is expressed in microseconds. 
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, parameters 1 through 5 are 
      unused.
      
      In this description, PCR is the greater of either the PCR or the 
      requested shaping rate (parameter 1 or parameter 5) specified in the 
      txTrafficDescParm attribute under the Vcd Tm or Vpd Tm 
      component.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 or 1 traffic; parameters 2 and 3 are unused.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the 
      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the 
      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8, parameter 4 reflects 
      the actual shaping rate in cell/s for this connection. For CQC-based 
      ATM cards, the set of available shaping rates is based on the 
      number of interfaces doing shaping (attribute 
      perVcQueueInterfaces), and the shapingScalingFactor attribute of 
      the Arc Cqc Override component. A rate of zero (0) indicates that 
      shaping is not performed, or that the interface is down. 
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 9, parameter 1 represents the PCR; 
      parameter 2 represents the Cell Delay Variation Toleration (CDVT); 
      parameter 3 represents the Minimum Cell Rate (MCR); the meaning 
      of parameter 4 depends upon the value of the abrConnectionType 
      attribute. if abrConnectionType is sourceDest or 
      virtualSourceDest, parameter 4 represents the Allowed Cell Rate 
      (ACR); If abrConnectionType is erSwitch, parameter 4 represents 
      the Explicit Rate (ER); and if abrConnectionType is efciSwitch, 
      parameter 4 reflects the actual shaping rate in cell/s for this 
      connection.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, parameter 5 reflects 
      the equivalent cell rate in cell/s for this connection as determined by 
      the Connection Admission Control (CAC) algorithm. The 
      equivalent cell rate is useful in determining the admission 
      characteristics of this connection."

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute contains the current state of the receive side OAM cell 
      congestion for this connection. Its value reflects whether the rate of 
      received OAM cells for this connection is below a specified 
      threshold. The connection maintains a count of the number of OAM 
      cells which are terminated per second. Once that count exceeds the 
      specified threshold, extraction of all OAM cells for this connection 
      is disabled for a period of one minute. This is a congestion 
      management mechanism to prevent the processor from being 
      overloaded with handling OAM cells for a particular connection. 
      This mechanism ensures that tasks, such as trunks obtain enough 
      processor cycles to remain in service, and are not adversely affected 
      by excessive rate of OAM cells on a particular connection.
      
      The value is good when the rate of received OAM cells is less than 
      the allowed threshold.
      
      The value is bad when the arrival rate has exceeded the allowed 
      threshold. It remains bad for one minute, before returning to good 
      again. During this timeout, extraction of all OAM cells is disabled 
      for this connection. As a result, other loopback failure conditions 
      may occur.
      
      The value is unknown when the application has not yet begun to 
      use this connection. An example is the Test component before a test 
      has been started.
      
      Each type of OAM cell is counted separately. The threshold for AIS 
      cells is three cells per second. If more than three AIS cells are 
      received within a one second interval, this attribute is set to bad. 
      The threshold for RDI cells and each loopback type is also three, 
      but the threshold for trace cells is 250 per second.
      
      The state of this attribute has no direct effect on the value of the 
      operStatus attribute or on the number of troubled connections."

      This attribute indicates the ATM service category used for traffic in 
      both directions of the connection. 
      
      The constantBitRate service category is intended for real time 
      applications, that is, those requiring tightly constrained delay and 
      delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video 
      applications. The consistent availability of a fixed quantity of 
      bandwidth is considered appropriate for CBR service. Cells which 
      are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are 
      assumed to have significantly reduced value of the application.
      
      The rtVariableBitRate service category is intended for real time 
      applications; that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and 
      delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video 
      applications. Sources are expected to transmit at a rate which varies 
      with time. Equivalently, the source can be described as 'bursty'. 
      Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer 
      Delay are assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the 
      application. Real time VBR service may support statistical 
      multiplexing of real time sources.
      
      The nrtVariableBitRate service category is intended for non-real 
      time applications which have bursty traffic characteristics and which 
      can be characterized in terms of a PCR, SCR, and MBS. For those 
      cells which are transferred within the traffic contract, the application 
      expects a low cell loss ratio. For all connections, it expects a bound 
      on the mean cell transfer delay. Non-real time VBR service may 
      support statistical multiplexing of connections.
      
      The unspecifiedBitRate service is intended for non-real time 
      applications, that is those not requiring tightly constrained delay 
      and delay variation. UBR sources are expected to be bursty. UBR 
      service supports a high degree of statistical multiplexing among 
      sources. UBR service does not specify traffic related service 
      guarantees. No numerical commitments are made with respect to 
      the cell loss ratio experienced by a UBR connection, or as to the 
      cell transfer delay experienced by cells on the connection."

      the user is requesting an ATM only service from the network. In this 
      case, the network does not process any higher layer protocol. This

      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic.

      When txTrafficDescType is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8, parameter 4 reflects 
      the actual shaping rate in cell/s for this connection. This rate is one 
      of the set of available shaping rates for this type of ATM-FP, based 
      on the number of interfaces doing shaping (attribute 
      perVcQueueInterfaces), the provisioned cell rate, the 
      shapingScalingFactor attribute of the AtmResourceControl 
      component, and whether traffic shaping is enabled. A rate of zero 
      (0) indicates that shaping is not performed. 
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8, parameter 5 reflects 
      the equivalent cell rate in cell/s for this connection as determined by 
      the Connection Admission Control (CAC) algorithm. The 
      equivalent cell rate is useful in determining the admission 
      characteristics of this connection."

      This attribute is a vector of four traffic parameters whose meanings 
      are defined by the rxTrafficDescType attribute. The values of peak 
      cell rate (PCR), sustained cell rate (SCR) are expressed in cells/s. 
      Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in cells. Cell Delay 
      Variation Tolerance (CDVT) is expressed in microseconds.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, none of the parameters are used.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard; parameter 4 represents the 
      CDVT.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 4 represents the 
      CDVT.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is a 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT. 
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for

      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT. 
      
      If Upc is disabled for this connection, the values of PCR, SCR, 
      MBS and CDVT is a combination of provisioned parameters. If Upc 
      is enabled, the values of PCR, SCR, MBS, and CDVT is exactly the 
      values used by the usage parameter control hardware in policing the 
      arriving traffic. These may vary slightly from the provisioned values 
      due to granularity of the hardware. In the case where the PCR is 
      equal to the SCR, the effective MBS is zero."

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute is HISTORICAL. Please refer to the attribute of the 
      same name in the group AtmTmOper.
      
      This attribute indicates the queue limit and the discard thresholds 
      for the transmit queue of this connection. 
      
      The first element indicates the queue limit. Depending upon the 
      atmServiceCategory of the connection, the provisioned value of the 
      transmit queue limit is derived from the txQueueLimit attribute 
      under one of the subcomponents of the AtmIf CA component. If the 
      connection has traffic shaping disabled, then this attribute relates to 
      the common queue. If traffic shaping is enabled, then this attribute 
      relates to the per-VC queue.
      
      The second element is the threshold that marks the transition from 
      congestion state 1 to congestion state 0. This is the threshold at 
      which traffic with discard priority (DP) = 1 is discarded. This 
      threshold is set approximately at 90 percent of the first parameter, 
      the operational queue limit.
      
      The third element is the threshold that marks the transition from 
      congestion state 2 to congestion state 1. This is the threshold at 
      which traffic with DP = 2 is discarded. This threshold is set 
      approximately at 75 percent of the first parameter, the operational 
      queue limit.
      
      The fourth element is the threshold that marks the transition from 
      congestion state 3 to congestion state 2. This is the threshold at 
      which traffic with DP = 3 is discarded. This threshold is set 
      approximately at 35 percent of the first parameter, the operational 
      queue limit."

      This attribute specifies the ATM service category for both directions

      The value derivedFromBBC may only be used if the SrcPvc 
      component is provisioned under this Vcc.Otherwise a specific ATM 
      service category must be specified. 
      
      If this attribute is set to derivedFromBBC, the Broadband Bearer 
      Capability (BBC) and bestEffort attributes are used to determine the 
      atmServiceCategory of this connection. 
      
      If this attribute is set to other than derivedFromBBC, the value of 
      this attribute is used to override the provisioned BBC Information 
      Element parameters. In those cases, the BBC attributes are not used. 
      
      The constantBitRate service category is intended for real time 
      applications, that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and 
      delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video 
      applications. The consistent availability of a fixed quantity of 
      bandwidth is considered appropriate for CBR service. Cells which 
      are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are 
      assumed to be of significantly reduce value to the application.
      
      The rtVariableBitRate service category is intended for real time 
      applications, that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and 
      delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video 
      applications. Sources are expected to transmit at a rate which varies 
      with time. Equivalently, the source can be described as 'bursty'. 
      Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by CTD are 
      assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the application. Real 
      time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of real time 
      sources.
      
      The nrtVariableBitRate service category is intended for non-real 
      time applications which have bursty traffic characteristics and which 
      can be characterized in terms of a PCR, SCR, and MBS. For those 
      cells which are transferred within the traffic contract, the application 
      expects a low cell loss ratio. For all connections, it expects a bound 
      on the mean cell transfer delay. Non-real time VBR service may 
      support statistical multiplexing of connections.
      
      The unspecifiedBitRate service is intended for non-real time 
      applications; that is, those not requiring tightly constrained delay 
      and delay variation. UBR sources are expected to be bursty. UBR 
      service supports a high degree of statistical multiplexing among 
      sources. UBR service does not specify traffic related service 
      guarantees. No numerical commitments are made with respect to 
      the cell loss ratio experienced by a UBR connection, or as to the 
      cell transfer delay experienced by cells on the connection."

      Bearer Capability (BBC) attributes. The purpose of the BBC 
      information element is to indicate a requested broadband 
      connection-oriented bearer service to be provided by the network.
      
      The value derivedFromServiceCategory specifies that the actual 
      value which is used for this connection is derived from the value of 
      the atmServiceCategory. Either, this attribute must be set to 
      derivedFromServiceCategory, or the atmServiceCategory attribute 
      must be set to derivedFromBBC, but not both.
      
      Class a service is a connection-oriented, constant bit rate ATM 
      transport service. Class a service has end to end timing 
      requirements and may require stringent cell loss, cell delay and cell 
      delay variation performance.When a is set, the user is requesting 
      more than an ATM only service. The network may look at the AAL 
      to provide interworking based upon its contents. 
      
      Class c service is a connection-oriented, variable bit rate ATM 
      transport service. Class c service has no end-to-end timing 
      requirements. When c is set, the user is requesting more than an 
      ATM only service. The network interworking function may look at 
      the AAL and provide service based on it.
      
      Class x service is a connection-oriented ATM transport service 
      where the AAL, trafficType (vbr or cbr) and timing requirements 
      are user defined (that is, transparent to the network).When x is set 
      the user is requesting an ATM only service from the network.
      
      Class vp service is used to specify a transparent VP service. When 
      the value of this attribute is vp, the user is requesting an ATM only 
      service from the network. In this case, the network shall not process 
      any higher layer protocol. This service differs from class x service 
      in that with the class vp service both the VCI field (except or VCI 
      values 0, 3, 4, and 6 through 15) and Payload Type field are 
      transported transparently by the network. This attribute value is 
      only applicable to SPVP connections."

      This attribute is a vector of five traffic parameters whose meanings 
      are defined by the txTrafficDescType attribute. The values of peak 
      cell rate (PCR), sustained cell rate (SCR) and requested shaping rate 
      are expressed in cell/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in 
      cells. CDVT is expressed in microseconds. The values of PCR, 
      SCR, MBS and CDVT are used for connection admission control 
      (CAC). The value of CDVT is only used for connections where the 
      atmServiceCategory is constantBitRate. For all other values of 
      atmServiceCategory, CDVT is ignored. The values of PCR, SCR 
      and requested shaping rate are used to determine the actual shaping 
      rate where traffic shaping is enabled.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, all of the parameters must be set 
      to zero.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and 
      parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value 
      in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is 
      used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be non-zero. Parameters 2 and 3 
      must be zero.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic with cell discard; parameter 2 
      represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 
      represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested 
      shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in 
      parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be 
      greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameters 1 and 2 must be 
      non-zero. Parameter 3 must be zero.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 2 
      represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 
      represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested 
      shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in 
      parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be 
      greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameters 1 and 2 must be 
      non-zero. Parameter 3 must be zero.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and 
      parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value 
      in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is 
      used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. 
      Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 
      5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 
      2.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the MBS 
      for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and 
      parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value 
      in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is 
      used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. 
      Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 
      5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 
      2.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the 
      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; 
      and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero 
      value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result 
      is used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. 
      Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 
      5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 
      2.
      
      Whenever it is valid for PCR to be specified, parameter 5 may also 
      be used to specify a requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in 
      parameter 5 overrides the value in parameter 1 and is used as the 
      peak cell rate in calculations of CAC and shaping rate.
      
      For txTrafficDescType 3, 4 and 5, the transmit traffic is shaped at 
      the next rate less than the PCR. 
      
      For txTrafficDescType 6, 7 and 8, the transmit traffic is shaped at 
      the highest available rate which is between PCR and SCR. 
      However, if there is no available shaping rate between PCR and 
      SCR, traffic is shaped at the next rate above the PCR."

      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic. Parameter 1, 2 and 3 must be non-
      zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is any value from 3 through 8, parameter 
      4 represents the CDVT. If this value is zero, the CDVT is taken 
      from the ConnectionAdministrator defaults for the particular 
      atmServiceCategory of this connection.
      
      When rxTrafficDescriptorType is 3 through 8, there are certain 
      extreme combinations of rxTrafficDescParm which are outside the 
      capabilities of the UPC hardware. The check prov command detects 
      such cases and generates an error message. If this happens, adjust 
      the parameters until they fall within the supported limits. 
      
      To calculate the limits, use the following formulae:
      I1 = 1 000 000 000 / PCR
      L1 = CDVT * 1000
      I2 = 1 000 000 000 / SCR
      L2 = CDVT + (MBS - 1) * (I2 - I1)
      I1 and I2 must be less than or equal to 335 523 840. I1 + L1 must 
      be less than or equal to 1 342 156 800. I2 + L2 must be less than or 
      equal to 1 342 156 800. Note that I2 and L2 only apply when the 
      rxTrafficDescriptorType is 6 through 8.
      
      If the values of I1, L1, I2 or L2 are closer to the limits described 
      above, a further restriction applies. Specifically, if either:
      I1 > 41 940 480 or
      I2 > 41 940 480 or
      I1 + L1 > 167 769 600 or
      I2 + L2 > 167 769 600
      then both I1 and I2 must be greater than 20 480. 
      
      Parameter 5 of the rxTrafficDescParm is always unused. 
      
      If the rxTrafficDescType is sameAsTx, the values in this attribute 
      are taken from the txTrafficDescParm."

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute specifies the ATM service category for both directions 
      of the connection. 
      
      The value derivedFromBBC may only be used if the SrcPvc 
      component is provisioned under this Vcc. Otherwise a specific 
      ATM service category must be specified. 
      
      If this attribute is set to derivedFromBBC, the Broadband Bearer 
      Capability (BBC) and bestEffort attributes are used to determine the 
      atmServiceCategory of this connection. 
      
      If this attribute is set to other than derivedFromBBC, the value of 
      this attribute is used to override the provisioned BBC Information 
      Element parameters. In those cases, the BBC attributes are not used. 
      
      The constantBitRate service category is intended for real time 
      applications, that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and 
      delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video 
      applications. The consistent availability of a fixed quantity of 
      bandwidth is considered appropriate for CBR service. Cells which 
      are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are 
      assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the application.
      
      The rtVariableBitRate service category is intended for real time 
      applications, that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and 
      delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video 
      applications. Sources are expected to transmit at a rate which varies 
      with time. Equivalently, the source can be described as 'bursty'. 
      Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by CTD are 
      assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the application. Real 
      time VBR service may support statistical multiplexing of real time 
      sources.
      
      The nrtVariableBitRate service category is intended for non-real 
      time applications which have bursty traffic characteristics and which 
      can be characterized in terms of a PCR, SCR, and MBS. For those 
      cells which are transferred within the traffic contract, the application 
      expects a low cell loss ratio. For all connections, it expects a bound 
      on the mean cell transfer delay. Non-real time VBR service may 
      support statistical multiplexing of connections. 
      
      The availableBitRate service is an ATM layer service category for 
      which the limiting ATM layer transfer characteristics provided by 
      the network may change subsequent to connection establishment. 
      ABR service has a flow control mechanism which supports several 
      types of feedback to control the source rate in response to changing 
      ATM layer transfer characteristics. ABR service is not intended to 
      support real-time applications. 
      
      The unspecifiedBitRate service is intended for non-real time 
      applications; that is, those not requiring tightly constrained delay 
      and delay variation. UBR sources are expected to be bursty. UBR 
      service supports a high degree of statistical multiplexing among 
      sources. UBR service does not specify traffic related service 
      guarantees. No numerical commitments are made with respect to 
      the cell loss ratio experienced by a UBR connection, or as to the 
      cell transfer delay experienced by cells on the connection."

     "This attribute specifies whether packet-wise discard functions are to 
      be enabled or disabled in the transmit data direction for this 
      connection. Packet-wise discard functions should only be requested 
      if this connection is transferring AAL5 frame traffic. This attribute 
      is not applicable for Vpts.
      
      Packet-wise functions increase the 'goodput' of the link. The 
      transmit packet-wise functions are Early Packet Discard (EPD) and 
      Partial Packet Discard (PPD). 
      
      EPD allows the connection to discard an entire frame once the 
      transmit queue has reached the EPD threshold. EPD increases the 
      'goodput' of a link, since discarding an entire frame means that 
      some queue capacity is guarded for some other frame which is 
      already partially transmitted. All cells of the frame are discarded 
      from the Beginning of Message (BOM) cell up to and including the 
      End of Message (EOM) cell. 
      
      PPD allows the connection to discard the remainder of a cell-
      forwarded AAL5 frame if one cell of this frame has been discarded. 
      All cells are discarded up to but not including the EOM cell. The 
      PPD function increases the 'goodput' of the link, since cells which 
      are only going to be discarded at the AAL5 reassembly point are 
      not transmitted.
      
      On CQC-based ATM cards, the packet-wise discard functions are 
      PPD and EPD. PPD is available at VCC cell-transfer points. PPD is 
      not applicable at frame-cell conversion points, and is not applicable 
      for Vpcs. PPD is configured by this attribute. Packet-wise discard 
      should only be enabled for connections carrying AAL5 
      segmentation traffic. Setting the value to enabled for any other 
      traffic type may result in all traffic being discarded. On CQC-based 
      ATM FPs, EPD is automatically enabled at frame-to-cell conversion 
      points, independent of the setting of this attribute. 
      
      On CQC-based ATM cards, at a permanent VCC connection 
      endpoint, this attribute is not applicable and is ignored. If AAL5 
      segmentation and reassembly has been requested, PPD and Early 
      Packet Discard (EPD) are automatically enabled.
      
      On ATM IP cards, packet-wise discard functions include EPD and 
      PPD. PPD and EPD apply to individual VCCs and VCCs within 
      VPCs at all connection points, including tandem VPC connections. 
      Both PPD and EPD are controlled by this attribute. This attribute 
      may safely be set to enabled for any connection (Vcc or Vpc) on 
      ATM IP FPs since they have the ability to automatically detect 
      AAL5-segmented traffic on a connection, and only enable packet-
      wise discards if AAL5-segmented traffic is detected.
      
      When this attribute is set to enabled, packet-wise discard functions 
      are applied to transmit traffic at this connection point. When this 
      attribute is set to disabled, packet-wise discard functions are not 
      applied to transmit traffic at this connection point.
      
      At a SPVC origin on a PNNI interface, a value of enabled specifies 
      that frame discard is requested in the backward direction. When this 
      attribute is set to disabled, backward frame discard is not requested 
      in the SPVC call setup.

      receive packet-wise function is Partial Packet Discard (PPD). 
      
      PPD allows the connection to discard the remainder of a cell-
      forwarded AAL5 frame if one cell of this frame has been discarded, 
      for example due to UPC. All cells are discarded up to but not 
      including the EOM cell. The PPD function increases the 'goodput' 
      of the link, since cells which are only going to be discarded at the 
      AAL5 reassembly point are not transmitted.
      
      PPD is available at all VCC connection points where UPC may be 
      activated. PPD is not applicable for Vpcs. 
      
      On CQC-based ATM FPs, packet-wise discards should only be 
      enabled for connections carrying AAL5 segmentation traffic. 
      Setting the value to enabled for any other traffic type may result in 
      traffic being discarded. 
      
      On CQC-based ATM cards, at a permanent VCC connection 
      endpoint, this attribute is not applicable and is ignored. If AAL5 
      segmentation and reassembly has been requested, PPD and Early 
      Packet Discard (EPD) are automatically enabled.
      
      On ATM IP cards, this attribute may safely be set to enabled for any 
      connection (Vcc or Vpc) since they have the ability to automatically 
      detect AAL5-segmented traffic on a connection, and only enables 
      packet-wise discards if AAL5-segmented traffic is detected.
      
      When this attribute is set to enabled, packet-wise discard functions 
      are applied to receive traffic at this connection point. When this 
      attribute is set to disabled, packet-wise discard functions are not 
      applied to receive traffic at this connection point.
      
      At a SPVC origin on a PNNI interface, a value of enabled specifies 
      that frame discard is requested in the forward direction. When this 
      attribute is set to disabled, forward frame discard is not requested in 
      the SPVC call setup. 
      
      The receive packet-wise discard functions that are active are visible 
      in the Vcc/Vpc Tm rxPacketWiseDiscard operational attribute."

      The actual ABR functionality which is in effect is visible in the

      For CQC-based ATM cards, the only allowable values are 
      sameAsCa, nonAbrInterworking or abrSwitch. If abrSwitch is 
      selected, the CQC implements EFCI marking behavior.
      
      For the 1pOC12SmLrAtm card, the only allowable values are 
      sameAsCa or abrSwitch. If abrSwitch is selected, EFCI marking 
      behavior is implemented.
      
      sameAsCa is used to request the default behavior as specified in the 
      CA Abr component for this Vcc. Otherwise, this attribute overrides 
      the default behavior. 
      
      virtualSourceDest is used to request that this connection point 
      function as a virtual source/virtual destination. VS/VD functionality 
      is only supported on ATM IP FPs.
      
      sourceDest requires that this connection point function as a S/D for 
      RM cells. S/D mode is automatically invoked at this connection 
      point either if this is a connection end point, or if the next hop 
      connection point is configured as nonAbrInterworking.
      
      nonAbrInterworking is used to request that this connection point 
      function as an interworking between ABR and non-ABR service 
      categories. This means that there are no RM cells on the link side of 
      this connection, and that the next hop connection point is 
      performing as an ABR sourceDest.
      
      abrSwitch is used to request ABR switch behavior for this 
      connection point. The ABR switch behavior is first, to confirm to 
      virtualSourceDest or nonAbrInterworking setting on the next hop, 
      and otherwise to implement ABR ER switch behavior. For CQC-
      based FPs, ABR switch behavior is implemented as EFCI marking."

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute is a vector of five traffic parameters whose meanings 
      are defined by the txTrafficDescType attribute. 
      
      The values of peak cell rate (PCR), sustained cell rate (SCR), 
      Minimum Cell Rate (MCR) and requested shaping rate are 
      expressed in cell/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in 
      cells. CDVT is expressed in microseconds. The values of PCR, 
      SCR, MCR, MBS and CDVT are used for connection admission 
      control (CAC). The value of CDVT is only used for connections 
      where the atmServiceCategory is constantBitRate. For all other 
      values of atmServiceCategory, CDVT is ignored. The values of 
      PCR, SCR, MCR and requested shaping rate are used to determine 
      the actual shaping rate where traffic shaping is enabled.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, all of the parameters must be set 
      to zero.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and 
      parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value 
      in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is 
      used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be non-zero. Parameters 2 and 3 
      must be zero.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic with cell discard; parameter 2 
      represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 
      represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested 
      shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in 
      parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be 
      greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameters 1 and 2 must be 
      non-zero. Parameter 3 must be zero.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 2 
      represents the PCR for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 
      represents the CDVT; and parameter 5 represents the requested 
      shaping rate. A non-zero value in parameter 5 overrides any value in 
      parameter 1. This result is used as the PCR. Parameter 1 must be 
      greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameters 1 and 2 must be 
      non-zero. Parameter 3 must be zero.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and 
      parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value 
      in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is 
      used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. 
      Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 
      5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 
      2.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the MBS 
      for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; and 
      parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero value 
      in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result is 
      used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. 
      Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 
      5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 
      2.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the 
      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic; parameter 4 represents the CDVT; 
      and parameter 5 represents the requested shaping rate. A non-zero 
      value in parameter 5 overrides any value in parameter 1. This result 
      is used as the PCR. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-zero. 
      Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. Parameter 
      5, must either be zero (unused) or greater than or equal to parameter 
      2.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 9, parameter 1 represents the PCR; 
      parameter 2 represents the CDVT; parameter 3 represents the MCR; 
      parameter 4 and parameter 5 represent are not used and must be 
      zero. Parameter 1 must be non-zero and must be greater than or 
      equal to parameter 3. Parameter 3 may be optionally zero.
      
      Whenever it is valid for PCR to be specified, parameter 5 may also 
      be used to specify a requested shaping rate. A non-zero value in 
      parameter 5 overrides the value in parameter 1 and is used as the 
      peak cell rate in calculations of CAC and shaping rate. When the 
      atmServiceCategory is availableBitRate (ABR), the shaping rate is 
      dynamically chosen, based on the ABR flow control mechanism, as 
      a value between the MCR and the PCR or the requested shaping 
      rate if applicable.
      
      For txTrafficDescType 3, 4 and 5, the transmit traffic is shaped at 
      the next available shaping rate less than the PCR. 
      
      For txTrafficDescType 6, 7 and 8 if linear traffic shaping is selected, 
      the transmit traffic is shaped at the highest available rate which is 
      between PCR and SCR. However, if there is no available shaping 
      rate between PCR and SCR, traffic is shaped at the next rate above 
      the PCR. 
      
      For txTrafficDescType 6, 7 and 8 if inverse-UPC traffic shaping is 
      selected, the transmit traffic is shaped at a variable rate which 
      conforms to the PCR, SCR and MBS of the connection traffic 
      descriptor. Inverse-UPC traffic shaping is available only on ATM IP 
      cards."

     "This attribute is a vector of four traffic parameters whose meanings 
      are defined by the rxTrafficDescType attribute. The values of peak 
      cell rate (PCR), sustained cell rate (SCR) and Minimum Cell Rate 
      (MCR) are expressed in cell/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is 
      expressed in cells. The value of CDVT is expressed in 
      microseconds. The values of PCR, SCR, MCR, MBS and CDVT 
      are used for usage parameter control (UPC).
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, all of the parameters must be set 
      to zero (unused).
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic. Parameter 1 must be non-zero. 
      Parameters 2 and 3 must be set to zero (unused).
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR 
      for CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard. Parameters 1 and 2 must be 
      non-zero. Parameter 3 must be set to zero (unused). Parameter 1 
      must be greater than or equal to parameter 2.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging. Parameters 1 and 2 must be 
      non-zero. Parameter 3 must be set to zero (unused). Parameter 1 
      must be greater than or equal to parameter 2.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is a 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-
      zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to Parameter 2. 
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the 
      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic. Parameters 1, 2 and 3 must be non-
      zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2. 
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the 
      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic. Parameter 1, 2 and 3 must be non-
      zero. Parameter 1 must be greater than or equal to parameter 2.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is 9, parameter 1 represents the PCR; 
      parameter 2 represents the CDVT; parameter 3 represents the MCR. 
      Parameter 4 is not used and must be zero. Parameter 1,must be non-
      zero and must be greater than or equal to parameter 3. Parameter 3 
      may optionally be zero.
      
      When rxTrafficDescType is any value from 3 through 8, parameter 
      4 represents the CDVT. 
      
      If the value of CDVT either in parameter 2 or in parameter 4 is zero, 
      the CDVT is taken from the CA defaults for the particular 
      atmServiceCategory of this connection.
      
      On a CQC-based ATM card, when rxTrafficDescriptorType is 3 
      through 8, there are certain extreme combinations of 
      rxTrafficDescParm which are outside the capabilities of the UPC 
      hardware. The check prov command detects such cases and 
      generates an error message. If this happens, adjust the parameters 
      until they fall within the supported limits. 
      
      To calculate the limits, use the following formulae:
      I1 = 1 000 000 000 / PCR
      L1 = CDVT * 1000
      I2 = 1,000,000,000 / SCR
      L2 = CDVT + (MBS - 1) * (I2 - I1)
      I1 and I2 must be less than or equal to 335,523,840. I1 + L1 must 
      be less than or equal to 1,342,156,800. I2 + L2 must be less than or 
      equal to 1,342,156,800. Note that I2 and L2 only apply when the 
      rxTrafficDescriptorType is 6 through 8.
      
      If the values of I1, L1, I2 or L2 are closer to the limits described 
      above, a further restriction applies. Specifically, if either:
      I1 > 41,940,480 or
      I2 > 41,940,480 or
      I1 + L1 > 167,769,600 or
      I2 + L2 > 167,769,600
      then both I1 and I2 must be greater than 20,480. 
      
      Parameter 5 of the rxTrafficDescParm is always unused. 
      
      If the rxTrafficDescType is sameAsTx, the values provisioned in 
      this attribute are ignored. The traffic parameters for the receive 
      direction are taken from the txTrafficDescParm."

-- The Test component allows test traffic to be sent over an ATM

-- by non-ATM port and line tests. The Test component requires 
-- exclusive use of its parent Vcc and cannot co-exist with other ATM 
-- service components (such as Nep, Nrp, and Loop).
-- 
-- An ATM connection test circulates traffic through a VCC having a 
-- Test component at one end and the other end configured to loop 
-- back ATM cells. The Test component generates test frames, 
-- transforms them into ATM cells using AAL5 segmentation, and 
-- transmits them through the VCC; the returned cells are received by 
-- the Test component, reassembled back into frames, and the frames 
-- are consumed.
-- 
-- The test frames generated by the test are grouped into two 
-- independent streams.
-- 1) The loading frame stream circulates a set of "loading frames" 
-- through the connection as rapidly as possible. The intent of this 
-- stream is to verify the operation of the connection under a 
-- controlled load.
-- 2) The verification stream transmits a series of "verification frames" 
-- through the connection; as each frame is returned, the Test 
-- component verifies its contents and the next verification frame in 
-- the series is transmitted. The intent of this stream is to verify that 
-- frames are not being corrupted.
-- The test can be configured to send frames from either or both 
-- streams. The size and content of the test frames can also be 
-- controlled.

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute indicates the ATM service category used for traffic in 
      both directions of the connection. 
      
      The constantBitRate service category is intended for real time 
      applications, that is, those requiring tightly constrained delay and 
      delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video 
      applications. The consistent availability of a fixed quantity of 
      bandwidth is considered appropriate for CBR service. Cells which 
      are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer Delay are 
      assumed to have significantly reduced value for the application.
      
      The rtVariableBitRate service category is intended for real time 
      applications; that is those requiring tightly constrained delay and 
      delay variation, as would be appropriate for voice and video 
      applications. Sources are expected to transmit at a rate which varies 
      with time. Equivalently, the source can be described as 'bursty'. 
      Cells which are delayed beyond the value specified by Cell Transfer 
      Delay are assumed to be of significantly reduced value to the 
      application. Real time VBR service may support statistical 
      multiplexing of real time sources.
      
      The nrtVariableBitRate service category is intended for non-real 
      time applications which have bursty traffic characteristics and which 
      can be characterized in terms of a PCR, SCR, and MBS. For those 
      cells which are transferred within the traffic contract, the application 
      expects a low cell loss ratio. For all connections, it expects a bound 
      on the mean cell transfer delay. Non-real time VBR service may 
      support statistical multiplexing of connections.
      
      The availableBitRate service is an ATM layer service category for 
      which the limiting ATM layer transfer characteristics provided by 
      the network may change subsequent to connection establishment. 
      ABR service has a flow control mechanism which supports several 
      types of feedback to control the source rate in response to changing 
      ATM layer transfer characteristics. ABR service is not intended to 
      support real-time applications.
      
      The unspecifiedBitRate service is intended for non-real time 
      applications, that is those not requiring tightly constrained delay 
      and delay variation. UBR sources are expected to be bursty. UBR 
      service supports a high degree of statistical multiplexing among 
      sources. UBR service does not specify traffic related service 
      guarantees. No numerical commitments are made with respect to 
      the cell loss ratio experienced by a UBR connection, or as to the 
      cell transfer delay experienced by cells on the connection."

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute indicates the traffic shaping state of the connection.
      
      A value of notApplicable indicates that traffic shaping is not 
      applicable or not supported for this connection. This is the case:
      - when the txTrafficDescType is 1 or 2.
      - for standard Vpt Vccs and basic Vpts.
      - for CQC-based ATM cards, when the atmServiceCategory is 
      constantBitRate.
      
      In these cases, the value of notApplicable is set regardless of 
      whether traffic shaping is enabled or disabled in the provisioning 
      data.
      
      For the 1pOC12SmLrAtm card, traffic shaping is not available, 
      therefore this attribute is always notApplicable.
      
      A value of disabled indicates that traffic shaping is applicable and 
      supported for the type of connection but has been turned off in the 
      provisioning data.
      
      A value of linear or inverseUpc indicates that traffic shaping is 
      applicable and supported for the type of connection and has been 
      turned on in the provisioning data. This is the only case that 
      indicates that traffic shaping is performed on the connection. In this 
      case, the actual shaping rate is reflected in the txTrafficDescParm 
      attribute, parameter number 4. A value of linear indicates that 
      traffic is being shaped at the constant rate indicated in 
      txTrafficDescParm 4.
      
      A value of inverseUpc is possible only on ATM IP cards. This value 
      indicates that the shaper strictly conforms to the requirements of a 
      dual leaky bucket UPC enforcer. This value is indicated if traffic 
      shaping is enabled, and the txTrafficDescType for this connection is 
      6, 7 or 8.
      
      Traffic shaping for connections with atmServiceCategory as 
      availableBitRate (txTrafficDescType 9) depends upon the 
      abrConnectionType attribute. If abrConnectionType is sourceDest 
      or virtualSourceDest, the value of this attribute is linear. If 
      abrConnectionType is erSwitch or efciSwitch, this attribute is 
      notApplicable."

      For CQC-based ATM cards and the 1pOC12SmLrAtm card, the 
      notApplicable, efciSwitch or nonAbrInterworking. In EFCI 
      marking mode, the Explicit Forward Congestion Indication (EFCI)

      congestion. 
      
      For ATM IP cards other than 1pOC12SmLrAtm, if the displayed as

      mode, the ABR Source and Destination behavior is in effect at this

      hop connection is the Vcc or Vpc identified by the nextHop attribute 
      of the Nrp or Rp component. 
      
      If the connectionPointType is not connectionEndPoint, the value of 
      this attribute depends upon the abrConnectionType provisioning

      The default abrConnectionType is provisioned at the CA Abr 
      abrConnectionType attribute, and may be overridden for a

      Tm abrConnectionType attribute. If the CA Abr abrConnectionType 
      attribute is virtualSourceDest at either one of the two connection 
      points, and if both the connection points are defined on ATM IP 
      cards, virtual source and destination behavior is applied to the

      virtualSourceDest.
      
      This attribute has the value erSwitch if ABR explicit rate 
      functionality is in effect at this connection. In this mode, the switch

      this connection point is functioning as an SPVC origin for an ABR 
      connection where the link side of this connection is configured as a 
      non-ABR ATM service category. This means that there are no RM

      connection point is performing as an ABR sourceDest."

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute is a vector of five transmit traffic parameters whose 
      mapping is defined by the txTrafficDescType attribute. 
      
      The values of peak cell rate (PCR), sustained cell rate (SCR), 
      Minimum Cell Rate (MCR), actual cell rate (ACR), explicit rate 
      (ER), equivalent cell rate (ECR), and actual shaping rate are 
      expressed in cell/s. Maximum burst size (MBS) is expressed in 
      cells. CDVT is expressed in microseconds. 
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 1 or 2, parameters 1 through 5 are 
      unused.
      
      In this description, PCR is the greater of either the PCR or the 
      requested shaping rate (parameter 1 or parameter 5) specified in the 
      txTrafficDescParm attribute under the Vcd Tm or Vpd Tm 
      component.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 3, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 or 1 traffic; parameters 2 and 3 are unused.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 4, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 5, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 6, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 3 represents the MBS for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 7, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell discard; parameter 3 represents the 
      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 8, parameter 1 represents the PCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 and 1 traffic; parameter 2 represents the SCR for 
      CLP equal to 0 traffic with cell tagging; parameter 3 represents the 
      MBS for CLP equal to 0 traffic.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8, parameter 4 reflects 
      the actual shaping rate in cell/s for this connection. For CQC-based 
      ATM cards, the set of available shaping rates is based on the 
      number of interfaces doing shaping (attribute 
      perVcQueueInterfaces), and the shapingScalingFactor attribute of 
      the Arc Cqc Override component. A rate of zero (0) indicates that 
      shaping is not performed, or that the interface is down. 
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 9, parameter 1 represents the PCR; 
      parameter 2 represents the Cell Delay Variation Toleration (CDVT); 
      parameter 3 represents the Minimum Cell Rate (MCR); the meaning 
      of parameter 4 depends upon the value of the abrConnectionType 
      attribute. if abrConnectionType is sourceDest or 
      virtualSourceDest, parameter 4 represents the Allowed Cell Rate 
      (ACR); If abrConnectionType is erSwitch, parameter 4 represents 
      the Explicit Rate (ER); and if abrConnectionType is efciSwitch, 
      parameter 4 reflects the actual shaping rate in cell/s for this 
      connection.
      
      When txTrafficDescType is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, parameter 5 reflects 
      the equivalent cell rate in cell/s for this connection as determined by 
      the Connection Admission Control (CAC) algorithm. The 
      equivalent cell rate is useful in determining the admission 
      characteristics of this connection."

      RM cells. When this limit is crossed, the Allowed Cell Rate (ACR) 
      value would be decreased by the amount (CDF*ACR), where CDF 
      is determined by the cutoffDecreaseFactor. The ACR is not allowed 
      to fall below the Minimum Cell Rate (MCR), in which case the 
      ACR is set to MCR.
      
      The value of CRM is obtained as transientBufferExposure divided

-- AtmIf/n EmissionPriority/n 
-- This component controls the characteristics of an emission priority 
-- for an AtmIf. This component is optional on ATM IP FPs. It is not 
-- permitted on CQC-based ATM FPs.
-- 
-- On ATM IP FPs, there are eight emission priorities (EP). EP 0 is the 
-- highest priority and EP 7 is the lowest priority. Normally, link 
-- bandwidth is allocated in strict precedence of emission priority. All 
-- traffic at EP 0 is transmitted on the link first. Then, when there is an 
-- unused cell opportunity, a cell from EP 1 is transmitted. When EP 0 
-- and 1 have nothing to send, then EP 2 gets the transmit cell 
-- opportunities. Each emission priority 2 through 7 has a 
-- corresponding Ep component with instance number 2 through 7. 
-- Emission priorities 0 and 1 do not have corresponding Ep 
-- components since there is no configuration which is relevant for 
-- those EPs. 
-- 
-- Traffic is associated with an EP in the following way. Each Vcc or 
-- Vpc has an associated atmServiceCategory. Under the AtmIf 
-- component there is a service category component which provides 
-- default characteristics for that service category. For example, AtmIf/
-- n CA Cbr/0 defines the default characteristics for connections of the 
-- CBR service category. Each service category has an 
-- emissionPriority (ep) attribute, for example AtmIf/n CA Cbr/0 ep. 
-- The value provisioned in that ep attribute maps to the corresponding 
-- EP component. If AtmIf/n CA Cbr/0 ep is specified as 2, CBR is 
-- associated with AtmIf/n Ep/2. 
-- 
-- EP 0 and EP 1 are in the absolute priority range. Traffic in the 
-- absolute priority range always gets first choice for a transmit cell 
-- opportunity. EP 2 through EP 7 are in the guaranteed bandwidth 
-- range. Traffic at EP 3 through EP 7 in the guaranteed bandwidth 
-- range may achieve a priority which is different from the strict 
-- hierarchical priority, if a minimum bandwidth guarantee is 
-- provisioned for an Ep.

   ACCESS     read-write
   STATUS     mandatory
   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute specifies the minimum bandwidth guarantee 
      associated with this EmissionPriority. A minimum bandwidth 
      guarantee is designed to prevent starvation of traffic at this EP by 
      traffic at higher EPs. Minimum bandwidth guarantees only operate 
      for EPs within the guaranteed bandwidth range 2 through 7. Note, 
      that for APC-based cards, EPs 5 and 6 are not supported.
      
      The minimum bandwidth guarantee specified is a percentage of the 
      bandwidth which remains after all traffic at EP 0 and EP 1 is served. 
      For example, if EP 0 and EP 1 traffic consumes 20% of link 
      bandwidth, the minimum bandwidth guarantee applies to the 
      remaining 80% of the link bandwidth. A minimum bandwidth 
      guarantee of 2% would actually result in this EP getting 2% of 80% 
      (total 1.6%) of the link bandwidth.
      
      The sum of minimumBandwidthGuarantee values for all Eps under 
      an AtmIf must not exceed 100%. 
      
      The value priority specifies that this Ep gets the bandwidth 
      guarantee which is applicable based on the hierarchy of emission 
      priorities. In this case, there is no minimum bandwidth guarantee. 
      
      For all non Apc-based cards the allowed value of the attribute is 
      between 0 and 48. Such a value specifies that from 1% to 48% of 
      the remaining link bandwidth is reserved for traffic at this EP. Given 
      a value n of minimumBandwidthGuarantee, then for n% of transmit 
      cell opportunities in the guaranteed bandwidth range, this EP get 
      first opportunity to send a cell. If this EP uses less than n% of the 
      link bandwidth, the extra opportunities are allocated in priority. Due 
      to scheduling and cell arrival times, traffic at this EP may not 
      necessarily achieve full utilization of its minimum bandwidth 
      guarantee. 
      
      When specifying a value for minimumBandwidthGuarantee, 
      consider the effect on cell delay variation (CDV) of traffic which 
      would normally be of higher priority. For example, if RtVbr service 
      category traffic is assigned to Ep/2 and Ubr traffic is assigned on 
      Ep/7 where Ep/7 has a minimumBandwidthGuarantee of 25%, there 
      can be a large impact on CDV of the RtVbr traffic. Traffic of the 
      Cbr or RtVbr service category which is sensitive to CDV and is of 
      known volume, can be assigned on EP 0 or EP 1 which are 
      independent of the effects of minimum bandwidth guarantee.
