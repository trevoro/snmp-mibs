	-- Ascend generates traps for important events.  The events are
	-- classified to allow traps to be enabled by class.  The trap
	-- classifications are:
	--
	--	error events
	--	port state change events
	--	security events
	--
	-- Traps may only be enabled from the user interface.
	-- Each trap contains an interface number to identify the trapping
	-- entity.  The slotIfTable can be used to translate the interface
	-- to a slot/item.

	-- error events
	--
	-- The error events reported are those defined in RFC 1215.  They
	-- are:
	--	coldStart
	--	warmStart
	--	linkDown
	--	linkUp

	-- port state change events
	--
	-- the port state change events are generated when a port changes
	-- state which is often a direct result of a call state change.
