              -- It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether
              -- the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table.
              -- Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to
              -- receive tabular information from agents that corresponds
              -- to entries currently not in use.  Proper
              -- interpretation of such entries requires examination
              -- of the relevant EntryStatus object.
              --
              -- An existing instance of this object cannot be set to
              -- createRequest(2).  This object may only be set to
              -- createRequest(2) when this instance is created.  When
              -- this object is created, the agent may wish to create
              -- supplemental object instances to complete a conceptual
              -- row in this table.  Immediately after completing the

              -- it may decide that the management station has

              -- it may set this object to invalid(4) to reclaim the
              -- entry.  A prudent agent will understand that the
              -- management station may need to wait for human input
