      DESCRIPTION 
          "This MIB module contains managed object definitions for  
           Pseudo Wire operation as in: Bryant., et al, 'PWE3  
           architecture', Martini, L., et al, 'Pseudowire Setup and  
           Maintenance using LDP', and Townsley, M., et al, 'Layer Two 
           Tunneling Protocol (Version 3)'. 


   -- Editor note: will add RFC numbers when available. 
           This MIB module enables the use of any underlying packet  
           switched network (PSN). MIB nodules that will support 
           PW operations over specific PSN types are defined in  
           separate memos. 
    
           The indexes for this MIB module are also used to index the 
           PSN-specific tables and the PW-specific tables. The PW Type 
           dictates which PW-specific MIB module to use.  
     
           Copyright (C) The Internet Society (date).  This version 
           of this MIB module is part of RFC yyyy;  see the RFC 
           itself for full legal notices.
