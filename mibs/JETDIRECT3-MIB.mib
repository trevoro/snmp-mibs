	"An entry contains the status of a file server connection.  Each

   To set a new serverConnTable entry perform an snmpset of the serverConn name
   including only the column.  The row will be returned.  

   IpxUnitName {.1.3.6.1.4.1.11.2.4.3.10.8.0} is used to synchronize novell
   stack operation when multiple connTable entries are required.
    
   Normally, all connTable entries are first set, and then
   IpxUnitName is set.  This triggers novell stack to reconfigure to use the
   the new connTable entries.
 
   New connTable entries are retrievable with get/getnext only after
   setting of the ipxUnixName.

----------- The Trap Destination Table --------------
-- The code which processes the trap destination table
-- utilizes a union to minimize data space.  This is a very
-- common "C" coding technique and adds important value.
-- However, it introduces a complication to the design of this
-- mib.  The "C" union results in multiple definitions for the 
-- table entries, depending on protocol.  There is no way (that
-- I know of) to provide a compilable mib which shows multiple
-- definitions for the objects.  To resolve this I am showing the 
-- AF_IPX object definitions commented out.

-- PML objects
-- Generally, if PML is supported by the JD card and printer, PML object 
-- requests are repackaged by JetDirect from snmp format into "pml"
-- and transmitted to the printer.  Upon asynchronous return from the 
-- printer, the "pml" format data is repackaged back to snmp format
-- and returned to the originator.  If a pml object request is received
-- by the JD card, and PML is not supported on that hardware combination
-- then JD card returns a NONAME error.

-- PML objects (.1.3.6.1.4.1.11.2.3.9.4.2...) are not defined by this mib.
-- For definitions see appropriate printer mibs.

-- The following PML objects are exceptions to the "general" passthru
-- processing described above.  For hardware combinations that support
-- PML, these requests are passed thru as described above.  For hardware
-- that does not support PML, JD attempts to provide the data from another
-- source (BIO, or Novell jobAccounting) rather than return the error
-- specified  above.  Mib definitions for these objects are contained in
-- the PML mib.  These are repeated here for reference.  They are commented
-- out to avoid compile errors resulting from incomplete tree.
