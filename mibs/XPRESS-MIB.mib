--
--
--                         Introduction
--
-- The RAC SNMP agent supports three separate management
-- information base (MIB) definitions.
--
-- An SNMP MIB has been defined for the XpressWay RLAN and the XpressStack;
-- the "RAC MIB". In addition to this MIB, the RAC SNMP agent also 
-- supports most of the groups from MIB-II (reference rfc 1158 and 1213) and
-- the ganEventLogTable from the Gandalf Generic MIB.
--
-- The "RAC MIB" consists of many attributes which are divided
-- into groups that can be read or configured by an SNMP Manager.
-- The "RAC MIB" is largely a proprietary implementation.
--
-- The RAC SNMP agent supports GETs, GET_NEXTs and SETs commands
-- for most attributes contained in the MIBs the agent supports.
--
-- The following document describes, in ASN.1, the RAC MIB.
--
--
--
--                      MIB Description
--
--        MIB-II groups supported by the RAC SNMP agent
--
-- Gandalf's implementation of MIB-II  follows  recommendations
-- from  RFC  1158.  This  has subsequently been updated to RFC
-- 1213.  RFC 1213 identifies ten groups that can optionally be
-- supported.   Gandalf chose to support the following 8 groups
-- for the RAC SNMP agent:
--
--
-- 1.   The System Group:
--        This group provides  contact,  administrative,
--        location,  and  service information regarding the 
--        managed device.
--
--
-- 2.   The Interface Group:
--        This group provides information  about  the  device's
--        interfaces.  Currently, only 1 interface is defined
--        for MIB II's Interface Group. It is :
--
--        a)   The Local LAN port.
--
--
-- 3.   The Address Translation Group:
--        This group contains a table  which  permits  mappings
--        from network addresses (e.g., IP addresses) to physi-
--        cal addresses (e.g., MAC addresses).  This  table  is
--        maintained by the system's Protocol Stack.
--
--
-- 4.   The IP Group:
--        This table provides information about the  system's
--        Protocol  Stack  IP layer.  Note that the ipRoutingT-
--        able is not supported by the system's SNMP agent.
--
--
-- 5.   The ICMP Group:
--        This table provides information  about  ICMP  traffic
--        addressed  to the system's Protocol Stack.  An exam-
--        ple would be PING packets.
--
--
-- 6.   The TCP Group:
--        This group provides information about the system's
--        Protocol  Stack TCP layer.  The TCP table can be use-
--        ful to monitor the amount  of  traffic  generated  by
--        operators  remotely  connecting  to the console.  The
--        tcpConn table can be useful to see who  is  currently
--        remotely connected to the console.
--
--
-- 7.   The UDP Group:
--        This group provides information about the system's
--        Protocol  Stack  UDP  layer.  The udpConn table shows
--        what protocols sitting on top of  UDP  are  listening
--        for packets (for example SNMP (port 161) or RIP (port
--        57)).
--
--
-- 8.   The SNMP Group:
--        This group provides information about the  system's
--        Protocol Stack SNMP layer.  It will give indications,
--        for example, on how much traffic or  how  many  TRAPs
--        the device's SNMP agent generates.
--
--      The RAC SNMP agent supports the following from the 
--      Gandalf Generic Group:
--      The  Event Log Group:
--        This group provides information about the system's
--        Event Log Messages. Along with the description, it also
--        provides information such as the time, date and severity of the
--        event.
-- 
--
--      RAC MIB groups supported by the RAC SNMP agent
--
-- 1.   The System Group.
--        This group is a complement to MIB II's System group.
--        It  contains  detailed information at the Box level e.g.,
--        diagnostics, eeprom rev, etc...
--
--
-- 2.   The Card Group.
--        This group is responsible for giving detailed  infor-
--        mation  for  each  of the possible I/O cards in the
--        system. This group defines a table,  indexed
--        by card numbers relative to the P2 backplane.
--
--        The RAC SNMP agent will let the Manager create and
--        delete cards through SNMP SETS. If a SET request is received with 
--        a valid rCardType and the rCardRowStatus attribute set to 
--        'createAndGo', the agent will CREATE a new card object.
--
--        If a SET request is received with the attribute rCardRowStatus
--        having the value of 'destroy', the card will be deleted from 
--        the system's database, only if no calls are currently
--        active on the card.If calls are active, a BAD_VALUE_ERROR will 
--        be returned to the Manager.
--
--        If the Manager SETs the rCardStatus attribute  to  the
--        OFFLINE  value, then all active calls will be dropped
--        and the card will be put into an OFFLINE state.
--
--
-- 3.   The D Channels group.
--        This group contains attributes used to configure D Channels 
--        and to monitor their statistics. The  group  defines two 
--        tables, both indexed by card number relative to P2 backplane and
--        by the 'S'interface on the I/O card.
--
--
-- 4.   The Channel group.
--        This group contains tables used to configure data-bearing 
--        channels and to monitor their statistics. These tables are indexed 
--        by card number relative  to  the  P2 backplane, 'S' interface on 
--        the I/O card  and one of the possible B Channels on the S Interface 
--        (except for the rlanChannelGroupTable).
--
--        It will not be possible to create or delete data-bearing Channels
--        through SNMP  SETs.
--
--        The read-only attributes will contain cumulative statistics 
--        of the particular data-bearing Channel since the last system reset.
--
--        In order to find out the CURRENT  statistics  of  a  particular  
--        data-bearing Channel,  you have  to  use the rSyncChanWanIndex
--        attribute,  which  indicates  the  logical WAN index this Channel is 
--        currently using to index into the WAN Statistic group. 
--
--        The rlanChannelGroupTable contains a list of channel groups available
--        to assign to the various channels. This table is indexed numerically.
--        The first index, being 1, corresponds to the default channel group 
--        which cannot be modified or deleted. If a SET request is received with
--        a valid rChannelGroupName and the rChannelGroupStatus attribute  set
--        to 'createAndGo', the agent will CREATE a new channel group object.
--
--        If a SET request is received with the attribute rChannelGroupStatus
--        having the value of 'destroy', the channel group will be deleted 
--        from the system's database, only if this group is not currently
--        assigned to a port or a Remote Lan. If so, BAD_VALUE_ERROR will 
--        be returned to the Manager.
--
--
-- 5.   The WAN Statistics group
--        This group will be indexed by an integer from 1..128. This value
--        will be used to index any particular WAN link. The statistics 
--        associated with  each  WAN  link are zeroed every time the WAN is 
--        disconnected.
--
--        It will also be possible to find out which data-bearing Channel
--        is  currently  using  this  WAN link  by accessing these 3
--        attributes given with each individual WAN link:
--        rWANStatsCardID, rWANStatsPortID, rWANStatsChanID.
--
--        With the help of rWANStatsRemLANID and rWANStatsRemLANName,
--        it is possible to find out which Remote LAN is actually
--        using this WAN link.
--
--
-- 6.   The WAN Summation Group
--        This group defines a set of  scalars  reflecting  the
--        statistics  summation of all the WAN link statistics on
--        the system since the system last reset.
--
--
-- 7.   The Remote LAN group
--        This group is indexed by an integer between 0 and 1000 which
--        corresponds to the Remote LAN ID, where 0 is the Default Remote
--        LAN configuration.
--
--        A Remote LAN can be created if the Manager sends  out
--        a  SET request with rRemLANStatus set to 'createAndGo',
--        and the rRemLANSerialNumber(if using SL/ML).
--
--        A Remote LAN will be deleted from the system's data-
--        base  if  the  rRemLANStatus attribute  is  SET  to
--        'destroy' and if the Remote LAN  is  currently  inac-
--        tive.  If  the Remote LAN is active a BAD_VALUE_ERROR
--        will be returned to the Manager.
--
--        The default Remote LAN can only be modified.
--
--        A total of 1000 Remote LANs can be configured or moni-
--        tored through SNMP SETs and GETs.
--
--        The rlanDestAddrTable contains the phone numbers, CLIDS,
--        channel groups and dial prefixes associated with the Remote LAN.
-- 
--        The rlanAddressPrefixConfigTable contains the dial prefixes 
--        available to be assigned to the Remote LAN. A dial prefix can be
--        created if the Manager sends out a SET request with rAddrPrefixStatus
--        set to 'createAndGo' and a valid rAddrPrefixName.
-- 
--        Also given in this group are all the  filtering statistics
--        associated with the Remote LANs.
--
--
-- 8.   The Local LAN group.
--        This group defines the  configuration  parameters  of the  Local LAN 
--        such as the type of connector used by the Local LAN ( AUI or P2 
--        backplane) and its Administrative State. You have to be careful
--        when configuring the Local LAN through SNMP. If the LAN is disabled 
--        by a community on the Local LAN, then the community will no longer be
--        able to talk to the system until the Local LAN is  re-enabled by the
--        console or another community defined on the system.  LAN Protocol
--        Filtering/Forwarding is defined here.  This enables the system to filter
--        or forward specific LAN protocols to and from the Local LAN.
--
--        It also defines all the statistics given by the LAN contoller chip.
--
--
-- 9.   The Local LAN Filter group.
--        This group gives  filtering  statistical  information
--        for the LAN port.
--
--
-- 10.  The Filter Configuration group.
--        This group defines the configeration parameters of the filters such as 
--        the aging time of Local and  Remote MAC addresses and if the system 
--        should age out MAC addresses or not.
--
--
-- 11.  The MAC Filter group
--        This group is roughly based on the dot1dStatic  group defined  in
--        RFC1286. It defines a table that could possibly go up to 4000 entries
--        deep and it is indexed by a MAC address. It contains information on
--        the MAC address type (static, dynamic  or  blocked)  and  its
--        Home Port.
--
--        It is possible to create a MAC address in the table by adding a row
--        to the table.
--
--        NOTE:  Because Dynamic addresses are subject to  age out and the table
--               can be quite big, it is recommended that if the Manager wants
--               to  traverse the table  with GET_NEXTs, that he does it with 
--               GET-NEXTs on all the attributes in this group.
--
-- 12.  The TCP/IP group
--        This group lets the communities configure the subnet mask, 
--        the network accessibility, the default gateway and the IP address 
--        for the system.
--
--        The Telnet group allows you to set security measures by configuring
--        the telnet access, IP address and Subnet Mask.
--
--        It is possible to lose contact with the system if the above mentioned 
--        groups are misconfigured. Be careful when setting these attributes.

--       The FTP group allows you to configure and initiate file transfers 
--       involving code, database or audit records.
--
-- 13.  The Blacklist group
--        This group contains a table that can be 64 entries deep. 
--        The table is indexed by an integer and contains the CLIDs (calling 
--        line IDs) that were black-listed by the system. Blacklisted CLIDs
--        can be created by sending a rBlacklistCLID and the rBlacklistStatus 
--        to 'createAndGo'. 
-- 
--        To delete a Blacklist entry, set the rBlacklistStatus to 'destroy'.
--
--
-- 14.  The Protocol group
--        This group contains a table indexed by a Network Address 
--        (IPAddress). All the entries define a triggering mechanism to make 
--        outgoing calls to Remote LANs based on Ip addresses. An entry can be
--        created by sending a rProtocolMask, a valid rProtocolRemLANID and the 
--        rProtocolStatus set to 'createAndGo'. 
--
--        To delete an entry, set the rProtocolStatus to 'destroy'. 
--
--        The table can go up to 510 entries deep.
--
--
-- 15.  The Pri Port group
--        This group will allow configuration and give statistical information
--        for the defined  ports on a PRI card. The switch type for the
--        PRI cards is configured in this group.
--
--        The  group  defines  a table, indexed by card number relative to the 
--        P2  backplane  and the port interface on the card.
--
--        The port cannot be created or deleted. It can modified, but only if
--        the card type is of type PRI. 
--
--
-- 16.  The IPX group
--        This group allows you to configure the Watchdog spoofing
--        and the timer on a system-wide basis. SAP learning can be
--        controlled by this group although the system has to  be disabled
--        (no bridging and no active calls) to enable SAP learning.
--        Learning can be enable with two options:
--          saving the static SAPs already learnt or deleting them.
--
-- 17.  The SAP Group
--        The rlanSAPTable contains the IPX Service Advertising Protocol table
--        entries and all the information that is included in the SAP frames.
--
--        During SAP learning, the user can delete or modify SAP entries in
--        the SAP table. This includes deleting entries or changing them from
--        static to dynamic. 
--
--        Creating entries is possible if the network that this SAP resides on
--        is already in the RIP table. All read-write attributes and the
--        rSAPStatus set to 'createAndGo' must be sent in a create. 
--
--        To delete an entry, set the rSAPStatus to 'destroy'.
--
--        These entries are indexed by SAPServiceType and SAPServerName.
--
--        The rlanSAPGroupTable contains a list of sap groups available to 
--        assign to the various saps. This table is indexed numerically. 
--        The first index, being 1 corresponds to the ALL sap group which cannot
--        be modified or deleted. The second index corresponds to the default  
--        sap group which also cannot be modified or deleted.
--
--        To create a sap group, send a SET request with a valid rSAPGroupName 
--        and the rSAPGroupStatus attribute set to 'createAndGo'.
--
--        If a SET request is received with the attribute rSAPGroupStatus
--        having the value of 'destroy', the sap group will be deleted 
--        from the sytem's database, only if this group is not currently
--        assigned to a Remote Lan. If so, BAD_VALUE_ERROR will be returned to 
--        the Manager.
--
--
-- 18.  The RIP Group
--        This table contains read-only information from the IPX Routing
--        Information Protocol frames received from the Local Lan.
--
--
-- 19. The SnmpGroup 
--       This group contain tables to allow configuration of communities, trap 
--       communities, trap profiles and mib views.
--
--       The rlanSnmpSetStatus attribute gives more information as to why 
--       the last set attempt failed.
--
--       The rlanSnmpCommunityTable allows configuration of Snmp Communites 
--       and to set the corresponding view.
--
--       To create an Snmp Community, send a SET request with a valid 
--       rSnmpCommunityName and rSnmpCommunityRowStatus set to 'createAndGo'.
--       The view will be defaulted to the default view unless specified.
--  
--       To delete an Snmp Community, set the rSnmpCommunityRowStatus to 
--       'destroy'.
--
--       The rlanSnmpTrapCommunityTable allows configuration of Snmp Trap 
--       Communities.
--
--       To create an Snmp Trap Community, send a SET request with a valid 
--       rSnmpTrapCommunityName, a valid rSnmpTrapIP and rSnmpTrapStatus set 
--       to 'createAndGo'.
--  
--       To delete an Snmp Trap Community, set the rSnmpTrapStatus to 'destroy'.
--       
--       The rlanSnmpViewTable allows configuration of Snmp Mib Views entries.
--       Two available preconfigured views are the ALL and Default views.
--       These two views are not modifiable and cannot be deleted.
--       This table is indexed by integers.
--
--       To create an Snmp Mib View, send a SET request with a valid 
--       rSnmpViewName, and rSnmpViewNameStatus set to 'createAndGo'.
--       The new View's subtrees are the default subtrees upon creation.
--  
--       To delete an Snmp Mib View Community, set the rSnmpViewNameStatus to
--       'destroy'. A bad value error will be returned if the view is assigned
--       to a valid Snmp Community. 
--
--       The rlanSnmpViewTable allows configuration of Snmp Mib Views subtree 
--       entries. The preconfigured subtrees for the views, ALL and Default,
--       are not modifiable and cannot be deleted. This table is indexed by
--       the corresponding rSnmpViewNameIndex, and the subtree's object 
--       identifier.
--
--       To create an Snmp View Subtree, send a SET request indexed with a
--       valid rSnmpViewNameIndex and the attribute rSnmpViewStatus set to 
--       'createAndGo'.
--  
--       To delete an Snmp View Subtree, set the rSnmpViewStatus to 'destroy'.
--
--
-- 20. The Audit Group
--       This group contains configurable information on the maintenance and
--       ways of triggering audit record transfers.
--     
--     
-- 21. The Flash Group 
--       This group lists the files stored in Flash memory and gives additional 
--       information on each listing.
--
--
-- 22. The LAN Protocol ID Group
--        The rlanLANProtocolIDTable contains a list of protocol IDs available to 
--        select for filtering/forwarding. This table is indexed numerically. 
--        The following index are predefined entries:
--           122 Novell IPX/SPX  8137
--           123 AppleTalk ARP   80F3
--           124 AppleTalk       809B
--           125 Reverse ARP     8035
--           126 ARP             0806
--           127 TCP/IP          0800
--
--        Indexes 1-121 are reserved for future predefined entry expansion.
--        Predefined entries cannot be modified or deleted.
--
--        Indexes 128-149 are for user defined LAN protocol ID entries.  To create
--        a LAN protocol ID entry, send a SET request with a valid
--        rLANProtocolIDName and rLANProtocolID, and the rLANProtocolIDStatus
--        attribute set to 'createAndGo'.
--
--        If a SET request is received with the attribute rSAPGroupStatus
--        having the value of 'destroy', the sap group will be deleted 
--        from the sytem's database, only if this group is not currently
--        assigned to a Remote Lan. If so, BAD_VALUE_ERROR will be returned to 
--        the Manager.

	     Each bit of this bit mask corresponds to a sub-

	     significant bit of the i-th octet of this octet
	     string value (extended if necessary, see below)
	     corresponding to the (8*i - 7)-the sub-identifier,
	     and the least significant bit of the i-th octet of
	     this octet string corresponding to the (8*i)-th
	     sub-identifier, where i is in the range 1 through
	     16.
 
	     Each bit of this bit mask specifies whether or not
	     the corresponding sub-identifiers must match when
	     determining if an OBJECT IDENTIFIER is in this
	     family of view subtrees; a '1' indicates that an
	     exact match must occur; a '0' indicates 'wild
	     card', i.e., any sub-identifier value matches.
	     Thus, the OBJECT IDENTIFIER X of an object
	     instance is contained in a family of view subtrees
	     if the following criteria are met:
 
	     for each sub-identifier of the value of

		    viewSubtree.
 
	     If the value of this bit mask is M bits long and
	     there are more than M sub-identifiers in the
	     corresponding instance of viewSubtree, then the
	     bit mask is extended with 1's to be the required
	     length.

	     Note that when the value of this object is the
	     zero-length string, this extension rule results in
	     a mask of all-1's being used (i.e., no 'wild
	     card'), and the family of view subtrees is the one

--                     XPRESS TRAP TYPES
--
--      This section describes the trap types that the
--   system can generate.
--
--      The   SNMP    protocol   provides   a   mechanism   for
-- asynchronously notifying  management stations  of significant
-- changes in  the network.  This mechanism  is the  SNMP  trap
-- message. This section describes the general format for
-- all trap  messages generated by Gandalf's XpressWay RLAN and
-- XpressStack products.
--
--
-- Trap Formats
--
--      The  SNMP  trap  messages  are  composed  of  two  user
-- definable areas: the specific trap type and the VarBindings
-- (e.g.; the interesting information). The specific trap type is
-- an INTEGER  that is used to determine the specific trap that
-- has occurred. The interesting information contains one
-- object, the snmpTrapDescription, which consist of an OCTET
-- STRING which gives a complete description of the trap.  The
-- information will also include the card and port numbers when
-- applicable.
--
--
-- Generic Traps
--
-- The System will generate the coldStart , AuthenticationFailure
-- and enterpriseSpecific generic traps.
--
--    coldStart    trap (0)     A coldStart trap is generated when the
--                              device is restarted
--
--    athenticationFailure (4)  An authenticationFailure trap signifies
--                              that the sending protocol entity is the
--                              addressee of a protocol message that is not
--                              properly authenticated.
--
--    enterpriseSpecific (6)    trap specific to this the XpressWay RLAN or 
--                              XpressStack product
--
