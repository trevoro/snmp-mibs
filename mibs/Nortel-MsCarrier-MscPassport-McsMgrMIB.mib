-- required for FRF5 PVC and DPRS MCS functionality. The 
-- McsManager can run on one of a number of LPs. The LP of the 
-- active McsManager can be determined by looking at the currentLp 
-- operational attribute.

      The value inTest indicates that the resource is undergoing a test 
      procedure. If adminState is locked or shuttingDown, the normal 
      users are precluded from using the resource and controlStatus is 
      reservedForTest. Tests that do not exclude additional users can be 
      present in any operational or administrative state but the

      The value failed indicates that the component has an internal fault 
      that prevents it from operating. The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value dependency indicates that the component cannot operate 
      because some other resource on which it depends is unavailable.

      The value powerOff indicates the resource requires power to be 
      applied and it is not powered on. The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value offLine indicates the resource requires a routine

      capacity. However, the resource remains available for service. The

      it can perform its normal functions, and this procedure has not been 
      initiated. The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value notInitialized indicates (for a resource which does
