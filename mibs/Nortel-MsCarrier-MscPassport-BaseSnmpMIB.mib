      When no values are in the set, this indicates that either the attribute 
      is not supported or that none of the status conditions described 
      below are present.
      
      The value inTest indicates that the resource is undergoing a test 
      procedure. If adminState is locked or shuttingDown, the normal 
      users are precluded from using the resource and controlStatus is 
      reservedForTest. Tests that do not exclude additional users can be 
      present in any operational or administrative state but the

      The value dependency indicates that the component cannot operate 
      because some other resource on which it depends is unavailable.

      The value powerOff indicates the resource requires power to be 
      applied and it is not powered on. The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value offLine indicates the resource requires a routine 
      operation (either manual, automatic, or both) to be performed to 
      place it on-line and make it available for use. The operationalState 
      is disabled.
      
      The value offDuty indicates the resource is inactive in accordance 
      with a predetermined time schedule. In the absence of other 
      disabling conditions, the operationalState is enabled or disabled.
      
      The value degraded indicates the service provided by the

      capacity. However, the resource remains available for service. The

      The value initializationRequired indicates (for a resource which 
      doesn't initialize autonomously) that initialization is required before 
      it can perform its normal functions, and this procedure has not been 
      initiated. The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value notInitialized indicates (for a resource which does

      The value partOfServicesLocked indicates that part of the service is

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute is the View mask which, in combination with the 
      corresponding instance of SnmpView subTree, defines a family of 
      view subtrees. 
      Each bit of this bit mask corresponds to a subindentifier of 
      SnmpView subTree, with the most significant bit of the i-th octet of 
      this octet string value (extended if necessary, see below) 
      corresponding to the (8*i - 7)-th sub-identifier, and the least 
      significant bit of the i-th octet of this octet string corresponding to 
      the (8*i)-th sub-identifier, where i is in the range 1 through 16.
      Each bit of this bit mask specifies whether or not the corresponding 
      sub-identifiers must match when determining if an OBJECT 
      IDENTIFIER is in this family of view subtrees; a '1' indicates that 
      an exact match must occur; a '0' indicates 'wild card', meaning that 
      any sub-identifier value matches.
      Thus, the OBJECT IDENTIFIER X of an object instance is 
      contained in a family of view subtrees if the following criteria are 
      met:
      For each sub-identifier of the value of SnmpView subTree, either the 
      i-th bit of mask is 0, or the i-th sub-identifier of X is equal to the i-th 
      sub-identifier of the value of SnmpView subTree. 
      If the value of this bit mask is M bits long and there are more than 
      M sub-identifiers in the corresponding instance of SnmpView 
      subTree, then the bit mask is extended with 1's to be the required 
      length.
      Note that when the value of this object is the zero-length string, this 
      extension rule results in a mask of all 1's being used (no wild card) 
      and the family of SnmpView subTrees is the one snmpView subTree 
      uniquely identified by the corresponding instance of subTree."
