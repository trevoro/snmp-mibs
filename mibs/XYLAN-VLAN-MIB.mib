                      "Determines how this virtual port behaves when presented
                      with a Spanning Tree Explorer frame.  The value
                      'disabled(2)' indicates that the virtual port will not
                      accept or send Spanning Tree Explorer packets; any
                      STE packets received will be silently discarded.
                      The value 'forced(3)' indicates the virtual port will
                      always accept and propagate Spanning Tree Explorer
                      frames.  This allows a manually configured
                      Spanning Tree for this class of packet to be
                      configured.  Note that unlike transparent
                      bridging, this is not catastrophic to the network
                      if there are loops.  The value 'auto-span(1)' can
                      only be returned by a bridge that both implements
                      the Spanning Tree Protocol and has use of the
                      protocol enabled on this virtual port. The behavior of the
                      virtual port for Spanning Tree Explorer frames is
                      determined by the state of vStpPortState.  If
                      the virtual port is in the 'forwarding' state, the frame
                      will be accepted or propagated.  Otherwise, it
                      will be silently discarded."
