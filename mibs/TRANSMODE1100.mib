	AlarmClass ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
		DISPLAY-HINT	""
		STATUS			current
		DESCRIPTION		"The AlarmClass type categorizes the alarm, and is
	defined when the alarm is registered.  It is as defined in
	X.733, ITU Alarm Reporting Function:

            o communications.  An alarm of this class is principally
              associated with the procedures or processes required
              to convey information from one point to another.

            o qos.  An alarm of this class is principally associated
              with a degradation in the quality of service.

            o processing.  An alarm of this class is principally
              associated with a software or processing fault.

	      o equipment.  An alarm of this class is principally
              associated with an equipment fault.

            o environmental.  An alarm of this class is principally
	    associated with a condition relating to an enclosure in
	    with equipment resides."

	PerceivedSeverity ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
		DISPLAY-HINT	""
		STATUS			current
		DESCRIPTION		"The PerceivedSeverity defines six severity levels,
        which provide an indication of how it is perceived that the
        capability of the managed object has been affected.  Those
        severity levels which represent service affecting conditions
        ordered from most severe to least severe are critical,
        major, minor and warning.  The levels used are as defined
        in X.733, ITU Alarm Reporting Function:


            o The Indeterminate severity level indicates that the
              severity level cannot be determined.

            o The Critical severity level indicates that a service
              affecting condition has occurred and an immediate
              corrective action is required.  Such a severity can be
              reported, for example, when a managed object becomes
              totally out of service and its capability must be restored.

            o The Major severity level indicates that a service
              affecting condition has developed and an urgent corrective
              action is required.  Such a severity can be reported, for
              example, when there is a severe degradation in the
              capability of the managed object and its full capability
              must be restored.

            o The Minor severity level indicates the existence of a
              non-service affecting fault condition and that corrective
              action should be taken in order to prevent a more serious
              (for example, service affecting) fault.  Such a severity
              can be reported, for example, when the detected alarm
              condition is not currently degrading the capacity of the
              managed object.

            o The Warning severity level indicates the detection of a
              potential or impending service affecting fault, before any
              significant effects have been felt.  Action should be taken
              to further diagnose (if necessary) and correct the problem
              in order to prevent it from becoming a more serious service
              affecting fault.
              
	   o The Cleared severity level indicates the clearing of
	     one or more previously reported alarms. This alarm
	     clears all alarms for this managed object that have 
	     the same Alarm type, Probable cause and Specific
	     problems (if given). 


        When an alarm is cleared, an alarmCleared event is generated.
        This event clears the alarm with the AlarmActiveFaultId
        contained in the event.  It is not required that the clearing
        of previously reported alarms are reported.  Therefore, a managing
        system cannot assume that the absence of an alarmedCleared event
        for a fault means that the condition that caused the generation
        of previous alarms is still present.  Managed object definers
        shall state if, and under which conditions, the alarmedCleared
        event is used.

        The clear value of AlarmSeverity is an action which is used when
        a management station wants to clear an active alarm.  This is not
        possible on all systems, and thus an agent does not have support
        write access for this value."

	OwnerString ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
		DISPLAY-HINT	"255a"
		STATUS			current
		DESCRIPTION		"An OwnerString identifies the initiator or owner of a row
        in a table. This label is set by the initiator to provide
        for the following possibilities:

            o A management station may recognize resources it owns
              and no longer needs.
            o A network operator can find the management station that
              owns the resource and negotiate for it to be freed.
            o A network operator may decide to unilaterally free
              resources another network operator has reserved.
            o Upon initialization, a management station may recognize
              resources it had reserved in the past.  With this
              information it may free the resources if it no longer
              needs them.

        Management stations and agent systems should support any format
        of the OwnerString dictated by the local policy of the
        organization.  It is suggested that this name contain one or
        more of the following: IP address, management station name,
        network manager's name, location, or phone number.  This
        information will help users to share the resources more
        effectively.

        There is often default functionality that the device or the
        administrator of the agent (often the network administrator) wishes
        to set up.  The resources associated with this functionality are then
        owned by the device itself or by the network administrator, and are
        intended to be long-lived.  In this case, the device or the
        administrator will set the relevant owner object to a string starting
        with 'local'.  Indiscriminate modification of the local
        configuration by network management stations is discouraged.  In
        fact, a network management station should only modify these objects
        under the direction of the administrator of the agent system."
