PANDATEL-CHASSIS-MIB DEFINITIONS ::= BEGIN

 -- This mib describes the physical chassis construction that
 -- contains the currently managed devices by PANDATEL.

 -- A chassis may be a stand-alone box as well as a cabinet
 -- consisting of several racks and other components that contain
 -- lots of slots and modules.
 -- It may also contain one single device or various functional
 -- units.

 -- This mib module may be extended without notice, when needed.

-- * * * * * * * * *  *  THE CHASSIS GROUP  * * * * * * * * * * *

-- The chassis may be splitted into several components, which are
-- again containing none, one or more slots. Each slot may or may
-- not contain a module. These modules may again contain ports.

-- A virtual component 0 may refer to a stand-alone unit with or
-- without slots, when a component address is needed.
-- A virtual slot 0 may be used to address a fixed "main board" that
-- is not intended to be removed from the component, when a slot
-- address is needed.
-- Component 0 will not appear in the component table, because it
-- does not exist physically; slot (comp,0) may not appear in the
-- slot table, but it is not incorrect if it does so to clarify
-- functionality.

-- The chassis group is mandatory for all managed PANDATEL devices.
