-- Definition of the cx1000 LAN Convergence Group
-- April 8, 1994
-- Draft 2
-- Fred Mruzek
-- The Convergence element is used to convert the LAN connectionless 
-- data to WAN Connection Oriented data stream.
-- The Conv. is divided into three logical subcomponents:
-- Convergence Attributes Table which controls the convergence 
-- attributes such as connection setup, compression etc.
-- WAN interface table which defines attributes of used WAN service
-- Statistics Table - mostly error statistics
-- The tables are now indexed by the convergence port instead of ifIndex
-- which should be a simplification. 
-- The usual interface statistics on the interface are again covered by the 
-- cxInterfaces group.   

-- Modifications: Hien Quang Le    June 7, 1994
--
--    cxFwkServiceName, cxFwkServiceCardId, cxFwkServiceSapId: changed 
--         from read-write to read-only objects
--    cxFwkServiceVcAttributes: removed
--    cxFwkConnectOptions:      removed
--    cxConvRowStatus:                  added
--         cxFwkCircuitRowStatus:       added
--    cxFwkCircuitState:        replaced closing(4) by openFailed(4)
--
-- Modifications: Hien Quang Le    August 10, 1994
--
--    Modified descriptions of cxConvTearDownTimer,cxFwkServiceType,
--         cxFwkServiceCircuitMdu, cxFwkServiceCost
--    Modified cxFwkServiceType object values to "notSpecified" & 
--   "frameRelay" only
--      FM - revision 1.01
--    Setup and TearDown Timers were removed
--     cxConvEncapsulation was removed - 1294 is always on
--     cxCompression was removed - it is not available
--     cxCompression was reinstated 

-- Modifications: Claude Rocray    April 1, 1996
--
--    cxConvCompCompatibility was added
--    cxFwkServiceRouteRef was added
--    cleaned up unused objects (cxFwkServiceVcAttributes, 
--    cxFwkConnectOptions).
--    removed reference to software header files.
