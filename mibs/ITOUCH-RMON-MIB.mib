Describes the current operational state of the
alarm and allows you to make limited changes in
the state of the alarm for purposes of managing
its state.

You may set this field to one of: underCreation,
active, inactive, and delete.  All other values
report current status.

underCreation: Alarm configuration is incomplete.
You may modify alarm parameters.  No monitoring
is taking place for the alarm.  An alarm is saved
in a parameter file after configuration complete.
Select this state before changing a previously
completed alarm.

active: Alarm configuration is complete and active
monitoring of the alarm variable is in progress.
Select this state to complete an alarm or to begin
active monitioring of the alarm variable.

inactive: No monitoring of the alarm variable is
actively taking place.  Select this state when you
want to temporarily suppress monitoring for the
alarm.  Select 'active' to begin monitoring again.

delete: Select this state when you want to delete
this alarm and all log entries associated with it.

held: Active monitoring of the alarm variable is not
taking place because this system does not have RMON
Repeater Management set to 'enabled'.  Once you do
this, alarm monitoring begins automatically.

noHubCard: The target slot does not contain a
management card or repeater I/O card capable of
monitoring.  Monitoring will begin automatically
once the target slot is loaded with a supported
configuration.

oldFirmware: The I/O card in the target slot does
not contain monitoring firmware.  Monitoring will
begin automatically once that card has been loaded
with current scm firmware.

slotTimeout: The target slot did not respond to
attempts to activate the alarm.  May happen if the
management card in the target slot does not contain
monitoring software.  Monitoring begins automatically
once the target slot has been repaired or loaded
with current software.

slotFailed: Active monitoring of the alarm
variable stopped because the target slot was not
operating properly.  Monitoring automatically
resumes once the target slot has recovered.

monitorStopped: Active monitoring of the alarm
variable stopped due to some error.  This can
occur if the variable no longer exists because a
related configuration change has made it invalid.
Correct the condition and re-activate the alarm.

unknownVariable: The alarm variable specified by the
object ID is not recognized in the currently running
system.  Correct the entry.

keysMissing: One or more required key values are not
specified in the alarm variable object ID.  Correct
the entry.

noResources: Not enough system resources exist to
activate this alarm.  Reduce the use of packet buffers
or available memory and re-activate the alarm.

loading: The alarm is being read from a parameter
file and will soon be activated.  This condition
is transient.

activating: Monitoring of the alarm variable will
begin soon.  This condition is transient.

deactivating: Monitoring of the alarm variable will
stop soon.  This condition is transient.

unsupported: Monitoring for the alarm variable is
not supported by the target slot.  Monitoring will
begin once that card is loaded with current scm
firmware or software.

unknownAlarm: Monitoring stopped because the target
slot reset.  Monitoring will continue shortly.

inconsistency: Internal system error.

invalidFlags: Internal system error.

invalidSlot: Alarm specified for a slot which does
not exist in the chassis.  Modify and re-activate.

inaccessible: Monitoring of the alarm variable could
not begin.  This can occur if the key values are
invalid for the variable.  Correct and re-activate
the alarm.
