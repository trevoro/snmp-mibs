SnmpAdminString ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
       DISPLAY-HINT "255a"
       STATUS       current
       DESCRIPTION "An octet string containing administrative
                    information, preferably in human-readable form.

                    To facilitate internationalization, this
                    information is represented using the ISO/IEC
                    IS 10646-1 character set, encoded as an octet
                    string using the UTF-8 transformation format

                    described in [RFC2279].

                    Since additional code points are added by
                    amendments to the 10646 standard from time
                    to time, implementations must be prepared to
                    encounter any code point from 0x00000000 to
                    0x7fffffff.  Byte sequences that do not
                    correspond to the valid UTF-8 encoding of a
                    code point or are outside this range are
                    prohibited.

                    The use of control codes should be avoided.

                    When it is necessary to represent a newline,
                    the control code sequence CR LF should be used.

                    The use of leading or trailing white space should
                    be avoided.

                    For code points not directly supported by user
                    interface hardware or software, an alternative
                    means of entry and display, such as hexadecimal,
                    may be provided.

                    For information encoded in 7-bit US-ASCII,
                    the UTF-8 encoding is identical to the
                    US-ASCII encoding.

                    UTF-8 may require multiple bytes to represent a
                    single character / code point; thus the length
                    of this object in octets may be different from
                    the number of characters encoded.  Similarly,
                    size constraints refer to the number of encoded
                    octets, not the number of characters represented
                    by an encoding.

                    Note that when this TC is used for an object that
                    is used or envisioned to be used as an index, then
                    a SIZE restriction MUST be specified so that the
                    number of sub-identifiers for any object instance
                    does not exceed the limit of 128, as defined by
                    [RFC1905].

                    Note that the size of an SnmpAdminString object is
                    measured in octets, not characters.
