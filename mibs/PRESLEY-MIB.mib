--	Alert LED Conditions
--	================
--	
--	For each condition if the configuartion option has been set to Disabled,
--      an Active condition will not affect the Alert LED.
--	
--	There are three types of Alert Conditions, (1) State Alert Conditions, 
--      (2) Latched Alert Conditions, and (3) Threshold Alert Conditions.
--	
--	Any Condition configured as Disabled has no influence on the alert LED.
--	Each Condition is in iether an Active or Inactive state.
--	
--	State Alert Conditions can be configured to be either Enabled or
--      Disabled.  They are conditions that can occur when the system enters a
--      certain state.  The underlying problem has to be fixed in order to
--      Inactivate the condition.
--
--	The configuration options are to Enable or Disable activation of the
--      Alert LED when the condition arises. If a state condition has the
--      potential to effectively look like a latched condition it will have the
--      option of being Acknowledged.
--	
--	Latched Alert Conditions can be configured to be either Enabled or
--      Disabled, and when they are Active they can be Acknowledged.  They are
--      potential events that warrant raising a flag.  Latched alert conditions
--	have to be individually acknowledged to Inactivate the condition.
--	The options are to Enable or Disable activation of the Alert LED when
--      the condition arises.
--	
--	Threshold Alert Conditions are derived from Smart MIB Entries.
--	When the value exceeds a user selected threshold the Alert Condition
--      goes active.  When the utilisation has dropped below the threshold, if
--      there is noother reason for keeping the LED active, it is deactivated.
--	The configuration options are to Disable activation of the Alert LED
--      or to the activate the LED when the High, Medium or Low utilisation
--      condition arises.
--	
--	NetworkUtilization (1),
--	================
--	Network Utilization is a Threshold Alert condition with the threshold
--      settings -
--		Low	> 12%
--		Med	> 50%
--		High	> 80%
--	Network Utilisation will be checked once a second by reading the SNMP
--      object mrmMonRepBandwidth Used. The bandwidth used is a 'smart MIB'
--      object maintained as a part of the MRM MIB.
--	The default configuration will be High.
--	This feature is independent of the SNMP trap repRepTopUsage which
--      happens to utilise the same SNMP object and can be configured to trigger
--      at any chosen utilisation.
--	
--	NetworkErrorRate (2),
--	================
--	The Network Error Rate is a Threshold Alert condition with the threshold
--      settings -
--		Low	> 100 errors in 10,000 frames
--		Med	> 10 errors in 10,000 frames
--		High	> 1 error in 10,000 frames
--	Network error rate will be checked once a second by reading the SNMP
--      object mrmMonRepErrosPer10000Packets.
--	The errors per 10000 is a 'smart MIB' object maintained as a part of
--      the MRM MIB.
--	The default configuration will be Disabled.
--	This feature is independent of the SNMP trap repRepErrors which happens
--      to utilise the same SNMP object and can be configured to trigger at any
--      chosen utilisation.
--	
--	UTPPortPartitioned (3) & CoaxPortPartitioned (4),
--	====================================
--	Port Partitioning is a State Alert.
--	The partition state of each of the eight UTP ports and the Coax port
--      will be determined by polling the SNMP object mrmPortAutoPartitionState
--      once a second.  If any port has auto-partioned , the port is enabled and
--	the 'UTP / Coax Port Partitioned' configuration is Enabled the Alert LED
--      will be activated. When the port is no longer partitioned, if there is
--      no other reason for keeping the LED active, it is deactivated.
--	It should be noted that if the port partition configuration is enabled
--      and a port partitions, it will be shown on the Port Status LED and the
--      Alert LED.
--	Disabling a port will not de-activate any possible port partition state,
--      but will de-activate the LED.
--	The default configuration will be Enabled for UTP and Disabled for COAX.
--	This feature is independent of the SNMP trap repPartitionStateChange and
--      the SNMP object mrmPortPartitionEvent used to configure whether the trap
--      is generated.
--	
--	LoginSecurityViolation (5),
--	===================
--	Login Security Violation is a Latched Condition.
--	When ever the SNMP trap securityViolation is generated and the 'Forms
--      Login Security Violation' configuration is Enabled the Alert LED will be
--      activated.
--	The default configuration will be Disabled.
--	
--	SNMPSecurityViolation (6),
--	===================
--	SNMP Authentication Failure is a Latched condition.
--	When ever the SNMP trap authenticationFailure is generated and the
--      'SNMP Authentication Failure' configuration is Enabled the Alert LED
--      will be activated.
--      
--	It will not be possible to enable the SNMP Authentication Failure
--      configuration while the SNMP object snmpEnableAuthTraps is set to
--      disable the generation of the trap.
--      The default configuration will be Disabled.
--	
--	PortSecurityViolation (7),
--	==================
--	Port Security Violation is a Latched condition.
--	When ever the SNMP trap secureViolation is generated and the 'Port
--      Security Violation' configuration is Enabled the Alert LED will be
--      activated.
--	The default configuration will be Disabled.
--	
--	StationConnectivity (8),
--	=================
--	Station Conectivity is a State condition.
--	This is a State condition that can appear to be latched and so can be
--      Acknowledged when Active.
--	When ever the SNMP trap polledTableFailed Trap is generated and the
--      'Station Conectivity' configuration is Enabled the Alert LED will be
--      activated.
--	When ever the SNMP trap polledTableSuccess Trap is generated and there
--      is no other reason for the LED to be active it will be deactivated.
--	The default configuration will be Disabled.
--	
--	AlertLedTest (9),
--	=============
--	The alertLedTest is a state condition.  It is by default Active.
--	The Enable / Disable configuration options can be used to test turning
--      ON & OFF the LED.
--	The default configuration will be Disabled.
