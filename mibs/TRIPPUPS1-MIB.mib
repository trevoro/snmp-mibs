	      zero, one, or may rows at any moment, depending upon
	      the number of alarm conditions in effect.  The table

	      creates a row in the table each time a condition is
	      detected and deletes that row when that condition no
	      longer pertains.  The agent creates the first row with
	      upsAlarmId equal to 1, and increments the value fo
	      upsAlarmId each time a new row is created, wrapping to
	      the first free value greater than or equal to 1 when
	      the maximum value of upsAlarmId would otherwise be
	      exceeded.  Consequently, after multiple operations,
	      the table may become sparse, e.g., containing entries
	      for rows 95, 100, 101, and 203 and the entries are in
	      chronological order until upsAlarmId wraps.

	      Alarms are named by and OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
	      upsAlarmDescr, to allow a single table to reflect well
	      known alarms plus alarms defined by a particular
	      implementation, i.e., as documented in the private
	      enterprise MIB definition for the device.  No two rows
	      will have the same value of upsAlarmDescr, since
	      alarms define conditions.  In order to meet this
	      requirement, care should be take in the definition of
