-- This is the GDC ds1 MIB for additional DS1 objects, that exist above
-- those that exist in the standard, RFC1406.
--
-- Support of this MIB requires a Privilege level of 'FULL CONTROL', for
-- the 551, 552a-1, 552a and the 552a v1.1.
--
-- This MIB is only usable when the configuration is software controllable.
-- If a GDC csu is HARD optioned, then errors will occur when trying to get
-- the information.
--
-- See the GDC SNMP Requirements Document to determine how the standard
-- DS1 MIB, RFC1406 is supported in GDC's products.
--
-- In each managed object, MIB term for variable, a description of what
-- the 551, 552a-1, 552a and the 552a V1.1 supports is available.
--
-- All csu*LineIndex objects like the dsx1LineIndex from rfc1406
-- define the instance of a specific Network Element.
-- The Network Element Address (NEadr) is set by a DIP switch on the NE.
-- The following formula is used to get to a specific instance:
--  Equipment side Index = (2 x NEadr) + 2
--  Network side Index = (2 x NEadr) + 3

		DESCRIPTION
			"This variable is used to initiate a specific test. It
			is used in conjunction with the dsx1LoopbackConfig
			managed object in RFC1406 Configuration Group.
			Setting dsx1NoLoop(1) stops all tests.
			Setting dsx1PayloadLoop(2) or dsx1LineLoop(3) causes
			that test to start as well as automatically setting
			this variable to other(1).

			other indicates that the dsx1LoopbackConfig option
			should be checked.

			The rest of the options have the following in common:
			Setting any of them causes that test to start as well
			as automatically setting dsx1LoopbackConfig
			to dsx1OtherLoop(4).

			csuLocalTest refers to a test that transmits a
			locally-generated test message through the DSU and
			looping it back at the network interface to the test
			equipment for verification. During this test, data is
			also transmitted to the T1 link, with pulse density
			constraints, but data is not received from the
			cascade port or the line.

			csuNILoop refers a test that tests the local DSU and
			the T1 link by transmitting a locally-generated test
			message through the local DSU to the remote DS1
			Interface Connector and looping it back to the test
			equipment for verification.

			csuCascadeDigitalLoop refers to a test that tests both
			DSUs' circuitry and the T1 link by transmitting a
			remotely-generated test message through the remote DSU
			to the local DSU's cascade port interface and looping
			it back to the test equipment for verification. This
			test loops only those DS0s allocated to equipment on
			the cascade side of the local DSU. DS0s allocated to
			the local DSU or to the DSU on the network side of
			T1 are unaffected.

			csuRemoteLoop refers to a test that activates the
			remote DSU's DS1 Line Loopback function or DS1 Test
			Loopback function, depending on which one is enabled
			in the remote DSU. This tests both DSUs and the T1 link
			by transmitting a locally-generated test message through
			the local DSU to the remote DSU and looping it back to
			the test equipment for verification. Bipolar violations
			are uncorrected during this test when the remote DSU
			has its LLB function enabled.
