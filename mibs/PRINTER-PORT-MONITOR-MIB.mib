        Compatibility Note:  At the time of publication of this MIB,

        possible future evolution of languages tags (in a successor to
        RFC 3066) to allow non-ASCII characters, this object has been
        defined with a syntax of UTF-8 (RFC 3629).

        This natural language tag is necessary for support of correct
        glyph selection for text display, for support of text-to-
        speech, for support of correct sorting of text values, etc.

        If this object is empty, then the natural language for all

        evolution of URI (in a successor to RFC 3986) to allow non-ASCII
        characters, this object has been defined with a syntax of UTF-8
        (RFC 3629).

             - 'lpr://foo.example.com/public-printer' (where 'public-
                printer' is the LPR queue name portion)
        and
             - 'ipp://bar.example.com/printer/fox'

        If this object is non-empty, then it SHOULD NOT conflict with a
        the default (e.g., IANA-registered) or explicit transport target
        port specified in 'ppmPortProtocolTargetPort'.  In case of
        conflict, the URI value in 'ppmPortServiceNameOrURI' is
        authoritative (e.g., 'ipp://example.com:631/~smith/printer').

        If this object is empty and 'ppmPortProtocolType' is
        'chLPDServer(8)', the LPR queue name MUST default to 'LPR'."

    DESCRIPTION
        "The protocol type of this printer port, specified as a value

        'chLPDServer(8)' for LPR (RFC 1179) or 'chPort9100(11)' for
        Raw), or zero if not specified.

        Compatibility Note:  The value of zero is NOT registered in the
        IANA Printer MIB.  It is an out-of-band value.  Thus the syntax
        of this object is NOT specified as 'PrtChannelTypeTC'.

        Systems that do NOT implement IETF Printer MIB v2 (RFC 3805)
        SHOULD use 'chPort9100(11)' for Raw printing (with an alternate
        port in 'ppmPortProtocolTargetPort', if necessary), because
        'chPortTCP(37)' and 'chBidirPortTCP(38)' are NOT defined in 
        IETF Printer MIB v1 (RFC 1759).

        Systems that do implement the IETF Printer MIB v2 (RFC 3805)
        MAY instead use 'chPortTCP(37)' or 'chBidirPortTCP(38)' for Raw
        printing, because 'chPort9100(11)' is DEPRECATED in IETF
        Printer MIB v2.

        Systems that implement any version of the IETF Printer MIB
        (RFC 1759/3805) SHOULD use the same value of protocol type for
        this port in the 'prtChannelTable', so monitoring applications
        MAY search for more channel information and status."
