        STATUS current
        DESCRIPTION
                "The protection status of a module.

		The  protection status of a module is part of the state of
		the protection machine (i.e., the hardware and software
		that implements protection). The protection mode of
		all the modules included in a protection group(pair) together represent
		the state of the protection machine for that
		protection group. The inputs to the protection state machine
		that cause the redundancy mode of a module to transition
		from one value to another are events such as module
		failure, card removal, user configuration, etc.
		The user can  force the redundancy machine transition to a desired state.
		
        The following values typically would be written:

		protection(1) - Creates a protection group that consists of two Main or Switch modules.	
		 
		lockout(3) - Make this module an active member of the protection group and doesn't 
		allow this state to be changed . This option is applicable only to the WAN module.  

		force(4)  - This module is forced to become a standby member of the protection group.
		This option is applicable only to the WAN the swich
		pack module. 

		manual(5)  - Makes this module a standby member of the protection group. This option is 
		applicable only to the WAN and the swich pack module.

		clear(6)      - Undoes all protection commands that have been entered for this module.
		Used to clear user requests: lockout,force, manual. Does not affect whether channel 
		is provisioned for protection).
		This option is applicable only to the WAN module.

        unprotected(7)  - Does not use this module in the protection group. This option is 
        applicable only to the WAN and Switch modules.


        Writing the above values may cause a switchover.

        When read, the values mean:

        active(2) - This module is an active member of the protection group.

		lockout(3) - This module is an active locked member of the protection group.

	    unprotected(7) - This module is not being used at present as a member of the protection  
	    group(unprotected).
                
		standby(8) - This module is a standby member of the protection  group.
		  
		unequipped(9) - This module doesn't have a corresponding redundant module.
               "

--	This group contains objects information about the System Level Resources
--	such as the system time, image version, operational status, power supply,etc.
-- 	It allows the user to change and monitor these resources of the Quantum Bridge
--	system that affect the whole system. It contains boot, save and restore 
-- 	information. The group includes the following sub-groups:
--	qbSysAgentGroup - supports objects that provision the SNMP agent. The group includes
--	       	     the qbSysAgentTrapDestTable trap destination table.
--	qbSysFileGroup (Obsolete)  - includes objects that provision the IOAS software images,
--		     backup and restore the NVRAM database to/from the
--		     remote host, and monitor the storage resources.
--		     The group includes the following tables:	
--		     qbSysBootImageTable - the table that contains a list of software images and 
--				           their locations.
--		     qbSysTransferTable - the table that includes objects for transferring files
--					  from/to a system over the network and from/to remote host(s).
--
--
-- 2. qbSysConfigParamsGroup -  contains objects that provides configuration security. The group 
--    contains only two scalar objects. In the future, this group will be extended.
--
-- 3. qbSysEventsGroup 
--	This group contains 6 tables and an assoicated set of objects that provide a generic mechanism for generation
--  retrieval, and notification of various System events and Alarms.
--
--  An Alarm differs from an Event in that an Alarm has a conditon attribute that
--  can either be 'raised' or 'cleared.' 
--
-- 	 qbSysAlarmTable contains a list of currently raised Alarms in the system.
--                                                                             
--   qbSysAlarmHistoryTable contains a history log of all Alarms that have been raised or cleared 
--    in the system.
--
--   qbSysEventHistoryTable contains a history log of all Events that have occurred 
--    in the system.
--
--   qbSysAlarmIdTable contains a description of all system Alarms and allows the enabling
--    of trap generation on their occurrence.
--
--   qbSysEventIdTable contains a description of all system Events and allows the enabling
--    of trap generation on their occurrence.  
--
--   qbSysNotificationHistoryTable contains a description of r2 qbSys Notifications. 
--
-- 4. qbSysModuleGroup
--      This group contains objects that allow the monitoring and configuring  
--	of the IOAS's cards. It includes objects that describe and provision 
-- 	attributes for individual cards.
--      This group includes the following tables:
--      1. qbSysModuleTable - this table contains attributes of individual modules of the IOAS  
--
-- 5. qbSysPortGroup (not implemented)
--      This group contains objects that allow the monitoring and configuring 
--	of the IOAS's ports. It includes objects that describe and provision attributes
-- 	for individual ports.
--      This group includes the following tables:
--      1. qbSysPortTable - this table contains attributes of individual ports of the IOAS.  
--
-- 6. qbSysIotGroup 
--
--      This group contains objects that allow the monitoring and configuring of  
--	IOTs. It includes objects that describe and provision system attributes
-- 	for individual IOTs.
--      This group includes the following tables:
--      1. qbSysIotTable - this table contains attributes of individual Iots that connect
--	to the IOAS. Some attributes from this table simply mirror the System group of the MIB-2.
--  	2. qbSysIotFileTable - this table contains information pertaining to the
--		   files used on the IOT and download information.
-- 7. qbSysInterfacesGroup 
--     The group provides a logical (ifIndex) to physical (rt.card.port)
--     mapping for the Quantum Bridge Access System. This information extends information
--     that is available in the ifTable table to physical ports. The Unified Quantum
--     Bridge interface table presents not only IOAS interfaces but also remote terminals 
--     physical interfaces.  
--     This group includes the following tables:
--     1. qbSysIfLocationTable - the table that contains the mapping of physical ports 
--	  to interface indexes.
--
--	qbSysNotifications(Notification group) - this groups contains a list of traps that are generated
--			     by the SNMP agent.
