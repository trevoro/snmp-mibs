   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute indicates the number of Logical Channels (LCh/n) 
      supported on this trunk. This attribute is used to allocate memory on 
      the trunk FP for the PORS forwarding tables.Unless running in 
      mapped mode on ATM hardware, the PathAdmin will add 100 
      channels to maxLc to reduce the chances of allocation clashes. 
      However, you should never see more than maxLc channels in use 
      for any extended period of time. On ATM hardware in mapped 
      mode the PathAdmin will only add 10 channels to maxLc to permit 
      more efficient use of the available VCC space.
      
      The PathAdmin may not be able to honor a request for maxLc 
      channels. This will happen when the neighbor PathAdmin asks for 
      less channels than this PathAdmin. To resolve the conflict the 
      PathAdmin will always pick the minimum of the two maxLc values. 
      This minimum value is called the negotiatedMaxLc and can be 
      viewed as an operational parameter of the PathAdmin.
      
      Note that in mapped mode on ATM hardware, the value of this 
      attribute provides an upper bound to the number of VCCs that this 
      Trunk/n PathAdmin can occupy. It is not a guarantee that maxLc 
      VCCs will be available to this PathAdmin because the VCC space is 
      a shared resource on the card or port."

      attribute on the trunk component on the other end of the trunk. If 
      this attribute is set to 100% connectionless traffic is given a 
      minimum of 1Kbit per second for administrative traffic. This 
      attribute may now be changed without the trunk being restaging. If 
      the value is decreased calls may be bumped as necessary to free up

      attribute as follows:
      
      unknown - not currently in busy state, type of forwarding not 
      determined yet.
      
      hdlcFrmMux - frames are being multiplexed (multiple LCh/n on 
      same port or channel) using HDLC encapsulation.
      
      aal5FrmMux - frames are being multiplexed (multiple LCh/n on 
      same ATM VCC) using the AAL5 segmentation and recombination 
      protocol. 
      
      spoFrmMux - frames are being multiplexed (multiple LCh/n on 
      same ATM VCC) using the Short Path Oriented segmentation and 
      recombination protocol. This is a proprietary protocol which 
      encapsulates voice frames into a single ATM cell unlike AAL5 
      which would require two cells to transport the 45 byte voice frames.
      
      aal5FrmMap - frames are being mapped (a single LCh/n per ATM 
      VCC) using the AAL5 segmentation and recombination protocol. 
      AAL5 mapped frames are forwarded by hardware in both directions 
      and require no CPU intervention.
      
      spoFrmMap - frames are being mapped (a single LCh/n per ATM 
      VCC) using the Short Path Oriented segmentation and 
      recombination protocol. SPO mapped frames are forwarded by 
      hardware in both directions and require no CPU intervention in all 
      but one special case. In particular CPU is required only if frames 
      are being forwarded to an LCh/n whose mode is spoFrmMux.
      
      cellMap - ATM cells are being relayed directly over the bus with no 
      segmentation and recombination protocol. The segmentation and 
      recombination is only done at transition points between frame based 
      cards and ATM cell based cards so this hop represents a pure 
      tandem cell hop, ATM card to ATM card. No CPU is required to 
      process these cells."
