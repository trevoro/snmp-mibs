-- These modules can form a "Distributed Router", hence the name.
--Notes
--===========
--1. Device = a single management entity, distibguished by its own IP address.
--
--2. Routing modules can work in one of two modes:
--  a. Router Mode - in this mode, the routing module is considered to be a 
--	"Device", with its own IP. In this scenario, the configuration table 
--		contains a single row.
--  b. EZ2route (aka Routerless) Mode - in this mode, the routing module is 
--	registerd under the Device's Master Agent. Potentially, several
--	router modules can register their part of the table. In this scenario,
--	The moduleId (aka slot number/ group number) is used as the 
--	distribution key.
--     
--3. This MIB group is written using SMIv2, as many of its constructs are 
--     imported from RMON-2
