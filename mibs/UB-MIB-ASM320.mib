-- BASIC CONTROL CAPABILITY
-- Implementation of all variables in this group is mandatory for all managed hubs.
-- BASIC HUB 
-- Row selection: the value of hmBasHubID.
-- The Hub group contains each card in a hub cluster, which is all the cards in an Access/One enclosure that constitute a single repeater.  Examples are multiple ASM320's attached to the Ethernet backplane bus to act as a single repeater (an Ethernet bus Hub Cluster, as well as single ASM320's not attached to the this bus.  
-- Any model of Ethernet concentrator (ASM320, ASM310, ASM300, TEC900, and FEC800) may belong to a hub cluster.  When a card is added to an Ethernet bus hub cluster it retains its Group (card) management data, but resets its Hub management data.
