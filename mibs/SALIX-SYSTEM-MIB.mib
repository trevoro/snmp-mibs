  -- Error reporting variables
  
  -- The following three variables provide a way of reporting SNMP errors        
  -- to the management station.  The SNMP agent keeps track three variables
  -- for each set request (last error number, last error message, and the 
  -- last Oid that was set and caused the error).  This information is based 
  -- on the incoming ipaddress and port, so there is only one instance
  -- available for each source.  The SNMP agent is responsible for correlating 
  -- the error reporting variables to the source Network Management System 
  -- (NMS) so that an NMS will only see errors that are a result of its 
  -- own set request.  If there is no errors available for this source, no 
  -- value is returned.
