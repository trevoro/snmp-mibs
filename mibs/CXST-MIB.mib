--  S/T-Interface Transceiver Driver Configuration Table
--  This table includes:
--  1) The configuration parameters such as the maximum duration allocated
--       for ISDN link synchronization on the NT/TE interface and the Power
--       Source 1 detection option;
--  2) The S/T driver status in particular port status, signal
--       received/transmitted across the S/T reference point, frame
--       synchronization indications;
--  3) Miscellaneous statistics such as the number of activation/deactivation
--       requests received by the I/O card, the number of down-to-up and
--       up-to-down transition transitions that occurred on the I/O card, etc.;
--  4) The controls to clear statistics, power up/down the S/T driver,
--       reinitialize the configuration and other controls.
