		   "This table provides per-cpu statistics and

                    every 60 seconds) updates data contained in
                    this table.  By periodically sampling entries in
                    this table, one can determine the percentage of
                    time spent by each CPU in their respective modes.
                    This percentage can be calculated by summing the
                    total 'ticks' spent in each mode and then dividing
                    the 'ticks' spent in each mode by the total.
                    'Ticks' is a system-dependent quantity whose unit
                    is not necessary when calculating the percentage
