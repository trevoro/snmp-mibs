    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB module is used to configure the community strings
        and trap destinations for SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c agents for Xedia
        products. It was originally written for the Xedia MADswitch
        product (based on a MIB developed by Avatar Consulting). This
        version of the MIB has been converted to SNMPv2 SMI but is
        still semantically equivalent to the original version (meaning
        the implementation of the MIB in the MADswitch is still
        compliant with this version of the MIB).

        Besides this conversion to the new SMI (MIB syntax) and many
        editorial changes, this MIB has one new object:
        trapSnmpVersion. See the DESCRIPTION clause for more
        information. (Note that adding new objects is a 'legal' change
        to make to new revisions of a MIB.)"
    REVISION "9401010500Z" -- ?? Not sure when the original version
                           -- was created
    DESCRIPTION
        "The original version of this MIB as shipped with the Xedia
        MADswitch product."
    ::= { xedia 1 }

-- Note that this MIB's OID does not fall under the xediaMibs branch
-- of the xedia enterprises tree since it predates that convention.

    DESCRIPTION
        "This is the community table. Each entry is composed of a
        community name, access based on network address, community
        access and a table of community views. This table can only be
        accessed if the community name matches configPassword. To
        add any entry the community name communityName must be
        created first. These defaults are assigned to the new entry
        all hosts, read-only access and no restriction on view
        (outside of agentConfig of course). To delete an entry, set
        communityName to NULL.

        Note that multiple rows can exist with the same
        Name/NetAddress values. The access granted will be the highest
        level of access. 

        If two entries exist with the same Name but one with a
        wildcarded NetAddress and the other with a specific
        NetAddress, the specific address entry overrides the
        wildcarded entry. This way, for example, read-only access can
        be granted to everyone using the 'public' community string,
        but notaccessible access (no access) can be given if they come
        from IP address 1.2.3.4."

	 sufficient.  See the ip address below, and the network mask.
	 
	 Although it is not prohibited, named entries in the table should 
	 not overlap.  During authentication, the first 'active' communityName

	 to be valid, since the number of restarts has been reset.
	 
	 Setting this value results in the following:

	     of the SNMP EngineID encoding as per rfc2271.  

           > an ASCII string results in the normal 'Text'

              and Privacy Keys to the super user.  Normally, viewing the
