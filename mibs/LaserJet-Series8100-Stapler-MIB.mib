                media to the overflow bin.  
                  cOutbinAttentionOverride - The device ignores the
                attention condition and continues printing.  
                  cBinderAttentionOverride - The device ignores the
                binder attention condition and continues printing.
                Additional information:
                This object describes the action that is performed
                when the JOB-OUTPUT-AUTO-CONTINUE-TIMEOUT expires.
                The action performed by the CONTINUE object being set
                to eInitiateAction or the GO key being pressed on the
                control panel may cause different actions. See the 
                CONTINUE object description for information on the actions
		that occur for those conditions.
                The cCancelJob item overrides the other two options, if
                it is set then the job will be canceled regardless of 
                the other settings.  If cJobCancel is not set then  
                cBinFullOverride will cause the printer to use the 
                overflow bin (Set by PML object OVERFLOW-BIN)in
                the case of a bin full condtion. If
                the cBinderAttentionOverride option is set then the
                finisher out warning will be displayed but ignored 
                and jobs will continue to go to the finisher anyway.
		OUTBIN3 is the topmost bin on the output device.  This bin
       	        replaces the left output bin on the base printer.  OUTBIN4
                through OUTBIN8 are the additional 5 regular bins supplied 
       		by the MBM5S device.  OUTBIN9 is the stapler unit and is
       	        the lowest bin in the device.
                NOTE: Because HP is marketing a device with a max of
                7 bins (MBM5S) the OUTBINn-OVERRIDE-MODE objects are
       		3-9 but the external device specification requires
       		support of up to 315 output bins.  Therefore if these 
       		bins exist above 7, then the coresponding objects will
       		also exist OUTBIN10-OVERRIDE-MODE through OUTBIN317-OVERRIDE-MODE.
       		The data for this object is stored in NVRAM."

        specifically indicates that the sub-unit places no
        restrictions on this parameter.  The value (-2) means
        unknown.  The value (-3) means that the printer knows that
        there remains capacity for at least one unit.

                STATUS-OUTBIN-FULL.
                The values reported for output sub-unit 1 (face-down,
                top bin) will be either (-3) if it is not
                full or (0) if it is full. 
                Output sub-unit 2 (face-up, left side bin) does not 
                have any sensing, so it will always report unknown (-2).
                The first output sub-unit (3) of the MBM reports
                either (-3) if it is not full or (0) if
                it is full.
                In mailbox mode, the MBM sub-units (4-8) will report
                (250) when empty, (125) when there's room for <250
                sheets and (0) when full. 
                The STAPLER sub-unit (9) will report (-3) when not full
                and (0) when full.
                Note: Due to MBM mechanism limitations, the value
                reported may not always be accurate (the bin status is
                detected only when the media delivery head is moved to
                or past a physical bin). Also, for stacker mode a bin
                is considered full as long as any bin above it is not
                empty.
                Default values assume all sub-units are empty and the
                MBM is in mailbox mode."
