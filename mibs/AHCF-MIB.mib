 -- ================================================================ 
 -- Advanced History Collection Framework MIB (ahcfMIB) 
 -- ================================================================ 
  
 -- The Advanced History Collection Framework MIB combines  
 -- mechanisms seen in the alarm and history groups of RMON mib to  
 -- provide user-specified history collection, utilizing two  
 -- additional control tables and one additional data table. This  
 -- function has traditionally been done by NMS applications, via  
 -- periodic polling.  The ahcf group allows this task to be  
 -- offloaded to an SNMP probe. Data (an ASN.1 INTEGER based object)  
 -- is collected in the same manner as any history data table (e.g.  
 -- etherHistoryTable) except that the user specifies the MIB  
 -- variable which needs to be collected. The user can specify a  
 -- scalar variable (a leaf object that can have only one instance)  
 -- or a columnar variable (an object that appears in a mib table  
 -- which can have several instances) for history collection. 
       
 -- The ahcfObjects group has three tables and one scalar group. 
 -- 
 --        1. ahcfConfigTable 
 --        2. ahcfInstanceTable 
 --        3. ahcfSampleTable 
 --        4. ahcfSysInfo 
  
 --   ahcfConfigTable: 
 -- ================================================================    
 --   ahcfConfigTable is an one-dimensional read-create table. The  
 --   management station MUST configure this table prior to using any  
 --   functionality of this framework. When a management station needs  
 --   to create a row in the ahcfConfigTable, it MUST provide at least  
 --   the object identifier of the particular MIB variable to be  
 --   sampled (ahcfConfigObjectVariable) and its type  
 --   ahcfConfigObjectType, whether scalar or columnar).   
 --   Each row created in the ahcfConfigTable corresponds to one or  
 --   more associated rows in ahcfInstanceTable.  
  
 --   When a management station successfully creates a row in this  
 --   table, the agent MUST check the oid type (ahcfConfigObjectType)  
 --   of the created row. If the ahcfConfigObjectType is columnar, the  
 --   agent MUST find out all the instances of the  
 --   ahcfConfigObjectVariable and create a row in ahcfInstanceTable   
 --   for each instance. Incase ahcfConfigObjectType is scalar, the  
 --   agent MUST create one row in the ahcfInstanceTable for  
 --   ahcfConfigObjectVariable. If a row in is ahcfConfigTable deleted  
 --   or deactivated, the agent MUST delete all associated entries in  
 --   the ahcfInstanceTable and the ahcfSampleTable. Each row in  
 --   ahcfConfigTable with ahcfConfigObjectType as columnar MAY be  
 --   associated with a set of identifier variables. The identifier  
 --   variables are a set of columnar variables of the same MIB table  
 --   as the ahcfConfigObjectVariable, whose values will uniquely  
 --   identify a row in the MIB table. The agent SHALL use the  
 --   identifier variables to uniquely identify a row in the MIB table  
 --   across many reboots of the SNMP agent or the host machine  
 --   running the SNMP agent.  
       
 --   The management station MAY choose to configure history  
 --   collection on specific instances of the ahcfConfigObjectVariable  
 --   through filters.  
  
 --   ahcfInstanceTable: 
 -- ================================================================    
 --   This table is a 2-d read-write table. Agent MUST populate this  
 --   table based on a row created in ahcfConfigTable. Each row of  
 --   this table is associated with only one row of ahcfConfigTable  
 --   and the row inherits common settings from the corresponding row  
 --   in ahcfConfigTable. The management station MAY also configure  
 --   settings for each row of this table.  
  
 --   Once a row is created in the ahcfInstanceTable, the agent MUST  
 --   start history collection such that a sample will be taken at the  
 --   next hour boundary. A sample MUST be collected and the value  
 --   stored in ahcfSampleTable at the specified intervals. Each row  
 --   in the ahcfSampleTable denotes a sample collected for a row of  
 --   the ahcfInstanceTable over a specific interval. Once the number  
 --   of samples reach ahcfInstanceBucketsRequested value, the oldest  
 --   samples MUST be overwritten with the new samples and number of  
 --   samples will stay at ahcfInstanceBucketsRequested value. If a  
 --   row's trending status (ahcfInstanceTrendingState) is disabled,  
 --   agent MUST not collect the samples until  
 --   ahcfInstanceTrendingState is enabled. If threshold checking for  
 --   this row is enabled (ahcfInstanceThresholdState) , the sample  
 --   value at each interval MUST be compared with threshold  
 --   parameters configured and a notification MUST be sent if a  
 --   violation is detected. The agent MUST also handle changes in the  
 --   MIB table that ahcfConfigObjectVariable belongs to if the  
 --   ahcfConfigObjectType is columnar (such as a row addition,  
 --   removal or change in the order of instances). 
  
 --   ahcfSampleTable: 
 -- ================================================================    
 --   The ahcfSampleTable is a 3-d read-only table containing the  
 --   sample data of associated rows in the ahcfInstanceTable. Each  
 --   entry represents the value of a single MIB instance during a  
 --   specific sampling interval (or the rate of change during the  
 --   interval). A sample value is stored in two objects an absolute  
 --   value and a status object. This allows numbers from -(2G-1) to  
 --   +4G to be stored.  The status object also indicates whether a  
 --   sample is valid. This allows data collection to continue if  
 --   periodic retrieval of a particular instance fails for any  
 --   reason. 
       
 --   ahcfSysInfo: 
 -- ================================================================ 
  
 --   This is a scalar group which provides the date, time and Time  
 --   zone of the agent machine. 
       
 --   ahcfNotifications: 
 --   The ahcfNotifications group contains the notification variable  
 --   definitions and notification definitions. 
  
 --   ahcfConformance:  
 --   The ahcfConformance group contains the conformance definitions  for 
 --   the AHCF-MIB.

                is meaningful only if the ahcfConfigObjectType is  
                'columnar'.  
  
                The identifier can be specified in terms of another     
                columnar oid of the same MIB table (or an augmented  
                table or a table that has the same INDEX clause as this  
                table) that will remain unique and constant over many  
                restarts of the management agent or the managed system.  
  
                The identifier oids can be of any ASN.1 type. The need 
                for an identifier oid is to counter the changes in the 
                ordering of rows in the MIB table. 
  
                The format for this variable is  
                ([Oid1][,Oid2][,Oid3]) 
  
                Maximum of 3 identifier oids can be specified. A  
                value of '()' is used as the default value for this  
                variable and it represents zero identifier oids. 
                For example, if the object being sampled is the disk  
                space usage defined in the Host Resources MIB  
                (RFC 1514)  
                hrStorage.hrStorageTable.hrStorageEntry.hrStorageUsed, 
                then the description of the storage medium  
                (hrStorageDescr) can be used as the identifier oid.  
                The value for this variable will be  
                (1.3.6.1.2.1.25.2.3.1.3) 
  
                The reason for using a identifier oid is because the  
                order of rows in hrStorageTable need not be same over  
                time. If there are two storage media ('/' and ' /usr') 
                and a new media is added (say '/var'), a new row may be 
                created in between the two existing rows in the table  
                making the contents of hrStorageTable ('/', '/var' and 
                '/usr'). This will change the index of the mib variable  
                hrStorageUsed for '/usr'. In order to obtain the new  
                index value for the row for '/usr' and to collect and  
                store the samples correctly, the agent uses the    
                identifier oid. Without the concept of an identifier  
                variable the agent cannot detect that the second row  
                now represents '/var' and will wrongly store the data  
                for '/var' in the samples for '/usr'"

           STATUS current 
           DESCRIPTION 
                "A filter for selecting the rows of a MIB table that  
                need to be sampled. This is meaningful only if the  
                ahcfConfigObjectType is 'columnar'. 
       
                A filter can be specified in terms of the  
                values of identifier oids given in                 
                ahcfConfigIdentifierVariables.  
  
                The format for this variable is  
                ([Oid1 Value][,Oid2 Value][,Oid3 Value]) 
  
                Oid1, Oid2 and Oid3 are the identifier oids specified  
                in ahcfConfigIdentifierVariables. Value for a maximum  
                of 3 identifier oids can be specified. A value of '()' 
                is used as the default value for this variable and it  
                will not be considered as a valid filter.  
  
                For example, if the object being sampled is the disk  
                space usage defined in the Host Resources MIB  
                (RFC 1514)           
                hrStorage.hrStorageTable.hrStorageEntry.hrStorageUsed, 
                and the description of the storage medium  
                (hrStorageDescr) is being used as the identifier oid.  
                If there are three logical storage media ('/', '/usr'  
                and '/var') and the user only wants to monitor the disk  
                usage of media '/usr', then ahcfConfigFilterType can be 
                set to 'inclusive' and ahcfConfigFilterSpec1 can be set 
                to (/usr) 
  
                If the user wants to monitor disk usage of all media  
                other than '/', then ahcfConfigFilterType can be set to 
                'exclusive' and ahcfConfigFilterSpec1 can be set to (/) 
  
                Maximum of three filters can be specified using  
                ahcfConfigFilterSpec1, 2 and 3. The filter specs MUST  
                be modifiable when the value of ahcfConfigStatus object 
                is equal to active(1). The agent MUST re-evaluate the  
                filters and retain the sample data for mib instances  
                which were being sampled before and which pass the new 
                filters also.  
  
                For example, if the ahcfConfigFilterSpec1 was  
                previously (/) and ahcfConfigFilterSpec2 is set to  
                (/usr), then the agent MUST retain the previous sample 
                data for the medium '/' and start collecting data for  
                '/usr'. 
  
                Note that if there are two identifier oids, the user  
                can decide to provide the value for only Oid1 in the  
                filters by leaving the value of Oid2 empty.  
                That is (<value for Oid1>,)"
