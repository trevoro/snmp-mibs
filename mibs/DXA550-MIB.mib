			for, 2 raised to (L - 1) is added to the sum.  For
			example, a node which performs primarily routing
			functions would have a value of 4 (2^(3-1)).  In
			contrast, a node which is a host offering
			application services would have a value of 72
			(2^(4-1) + 2^(7-1)).  Note that in the context of
			the Internet suite of protocols, values should be
			calculated accordingly:

-- the Address Translation group

-- Implementation of the Address Translation group is
-- mandatory for all systems.  Note however that this group
-- is deprecated by MIB-II. That is, it is being included
-- solely for compatibility with MIB-I nodes, and will most
-- likely be excluded from MIB-III nodes.  From MIB-II and
-- onwards, each network protocol group contains its own
-- address translation tables.

-- The Address Translation group contains one table which is
-- the union across all interfaces of the translation tables
-- for converting a NetworkAddress (e.g., an IP address) into
-- a subnetwork-specific address.  For lack of a better term,
-- this document refers to such a subnetwork-specific address
-- as a `physical' address.

-- Examples of such translation tables are: for broadcast
-- media where ARP is in use, the translation table is
-- equivalent to the ARP cache; or, on an X.25 network where
-- non-algorithmic translation to X.121 addresses is
-- required, the translation table contains the
-- NetworkAddress to X.121 address equivalences.

-- All representations of MAC addresses in this MIB Module use,

--        MacAddress ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE (6))     a 6 octet address in
                                                    -- the "canonical" order

-- significant bit first, even though 802.5 (in contrast to other
-- 802.x protocols) requires MAC addresses to be transmitted most

--
-- 16-bit addresses, if needed, are represented by setting their
