xifRowStatus OBJECT-TYPE

    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
    "This object is used to add entries to the ifTable.

    The object ifStackStatus, from the standard ifStack table is
    covered here as well. It is used to connect and disconnect
    ifEntries. 
         
    When creating a new entry, the value of xifRowStatus must be
    createAndGo(4). In addition, the ifName object must be supplied in
    the same PDU.

    Choosing the ifIndex value:

    While any ifIndex value may be supplied, in order to avoid an
    error and choose the best value for ifIndex, the xifNextIndex
    object should be used. It is a test-and-increment variable which
    means that the client must first get the present value and then do
    a set (on xifNextIndex) with that same value. If that sequence is
    succesfull then the client owns that value (until the next reset
    of the system unless the value is actually used to create an
    entry).

    Choosing the ifName value:

    The choice for ifName must conform to the format:

        <component-name>.<instance-number>.[<sub-interface-number>]    

    Special cases:
         To create the next correct ifName <instance-number> or 
         <sub-interface-number> the keyword 'new' may be used.

         For physical slots (the bottom of a physical the stack)
         the name format is slot.<slot-number>.<port-number>

         The bottom of the ipsec stack (virtual in the stack command)
         is ipsec-transform.1
         
    Example names are: eth.1 frame-relay.new, frame-relay.1.new

    Example SNMP sequence to create a new CBQ interface:

    get xifNextIndex.0
        value = 32
    set xifNextIndex.0 32
        <no-error>
    set ifName.32 'cbq.new' xifRowStatus.32 'CreateAndGo(4)'

    NOTE: A new layer and sub-interface may not be created in 
    the same request since two ifIndex values are required. If 
    both a new layer and sub-interface are offered, only the layer
    is created and no warning is given.

    Connecting and disconnecting ifEntries:

    In order to connect or disconnect created ifEntries, the ifStack
    table must be used. Each entry in the stack table indicates a
    connection between two ifEntries.

    For example, to connect an interface with ifName of eth.1 and the
    other with the name ip.1, the following would be done.

    If the ifIndex values are not known, the xsysIfNameIndexTable
    should be used. It has an index of ifName and returns the
    associated ifIndex.

    Once the ifIndex values of the two ifEntries to be connected are
    known, then create or remove an entry in the stack table.

    Example SNMP sequence to connect eth.1 to ip.1

    get xsysIfIndex.'eth.1'   (note instance value is a string)
        value = 20
    get xsysIfIndex.'ip.1'
        value = 24
    set ifStackStatus.24.20 'CreateAndGo(4)'

    To disconnect:

    set ifStackStatus.24.20 'Destroy(6)'
    
    Restrictions:
        To be consistent with the cli 'stack' command in most cases
        the stack can be built from the bottom. However, when
        connecting CBQ layers, there are some cases where it must be
        conneceted to its upper layer before connected to its lower
        layer. For instance, when connecting

                   eth.1 cbq.1 ip.1

        cbq.1 must be connected to ip.1 before eth.1 is connected to
        cbq.1."
