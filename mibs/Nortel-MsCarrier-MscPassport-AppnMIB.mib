      This attribute, if set to a value of throughput, indicates that the

      will depend on the DTE (i.e.: TDS&I is supported in X.25 only),

      is not required. At the point in time when it is required, the

      the TDS&I will be in a Facility Treatment component. Currently,

      routing is chosen by the calling party (as opposed to DPN, where 
      either end of the call can choose the default routing class).
      This attribute, if set to a value of normal, indicates that the default 
      class of routing is normal reliability routing. If set to a value of 
      high, then the default class of routing is high reliability routing.
      High reliability is the standard choice for most DPN and Passport 
      services. It usually indicates that packets are overflowed or 
      retransmitted at various routing levels. Typically high reliability 
      results in duplication and disordering of packets in the network 
      when errors are detected or during link congestion. However, the Vc 
      handles the duplication and disordering to ensure that packets are 
      delivered to the DTE properly.
      For the Frame Relay service, duplication of packets is not desired, 
      in which case, normal reliability may be chosen as the preferred 
      class of routing."

     "This group defines Frame Relay attributes collected by Frame Relay

      The purpose of Vc attributes is to aid end users and verification 
      people to understand the Vc internal behavior. This is particularly 
      useful when the network has experienced abnormality and we want 
      to isolate problems and pinpoint trouble spots. 
      Attributes are collected on a per Vc basis. Until a need is identified, 
      statistics are not collected at a processor level. Each attribute is 
      stored in a 32 bit field and is initialized to zero when a Vc enters 
      into the data transfer state. When a PVC is disconnected and then 
      connected again, the attributes will be reset. Attributes cannot be 
      reset through other methods. 
      Frame Relay Vc uses a best effort data packet delivery protocol and 
      a different packet segmentation and combination methods from the 
      General Vc. The Frame Relay Vc uses the same call setup and 
      control mechanism (e.g. the support of non-flow control data 
      packets) as in a General Vc. Most General Vc statistics and internal 
      variables are used in a Frame Relay Vc and are displayed by

      - obtains the required route characteristics from the COS database  
      using the mode name specified in the session request
      - determines all possible combinations of transmission groups and 
      nodes that form a route to the destination database
      - the actual characteristics of the Nodes and TGs in these routes are 
      compared against the COS tables that contain the required 
      characteristics of the session.  A weight is assigned based on how 
      well the actual characteristics meet the required characteristics. 
      Where there is no match between actual and required 
      characteristics, the route containing the node or TG is excluded 
      from further computation.
      - Each possible route is quantified by adding the weights assigned 
      to the node and TGs in the route.  The route with the lowest weight 
      is the one used for the session."

   DESCRIPTION
     "During route computation, APPN determines the optimum route 
      through a network in the following steps:
      - obtains the required route characteristics from the COS database  
      using the mode name specified in the session request
      - determines all possible combinations of transmission groups and 
      nodes that form a route to the destination database
      - the actual characteristics of the Nodes and TGs in these routes are 
      compared against the COS tables that contain the required 
      characteristics of the session.  A weight is assigned based on how 
      well the actual characteristics meet the required characteristics. 
      Where there is no match between actual and required 
      characteristics, the route containing the node or TG is excluded 
      from further computation.
      - Each possible route is quantified by adding the weights assigned 
      to the node and TGs in the route.  The route with the lowest weight 
      is the one used for the session.
      
      This attribute is part of the COS tables and specifies the minimum 
      acceptable speed for a TG using this Class of Service."
