-- Overview :
--
-- The Lucent Generic Download MIB defines up & download objects to 
-- control the transport of run & boot time images along with configuration
-- files.
--
-- The Lucent Generic Download MIB contains the following groups :
--
--  luOpTable      - This group contains objects that allow MIB guided operation
--                   of the device.
--
--  luDevice       - This group provides device information for all hardware
--                   and software components within a device. This MIB 
--                   identifies the Flash banks, NVRAM etc that can be 
--                   downloaded into.
--
--  luDownload     - This group contains all of the variables required to 
--                   configure / monitor a download to a device using TFTP
--                   or RPL. 
--
--  luUpload       - This group contains the variables required to configure
--                   and monitor an upload from a device using TFTP
--
--  luDloadNotification
--                 - This group contains the trap objects required to report the
--                   completion of an download or upload from a device using TFTP
