cxOsNbBufs OBJECT-TYPE
   SYNTAX INTEGER
   ACCESS read-write
   STATUS mandatory
   DESCRIPTION
"Determines the total number of data buffers to be created within the system.
System heap memory is reduced as the number of buffers is increased.
Range of Values: Depends on amount of installed system DRAM, as well as on
 requirements made by software during initialization. Cannot be set to a value
 larger than the one chosen for object cxOsNbSystemMsg.
Default Value: 1200"

cxOsBufSize OBJECT-TYPE
   SYNTAX INTEGER
   ACCESS read-write
   STATUS mandatory
   DESCRIPTION
"Determines the size in bytes of each data buffer.
Range of Values: 1 to 65535
Note: The maximum usable size depends on amount of installed system DRAM,
 as well as on requirements made by software during initialization.
Default Value: 292."

   DESCRIPTION
"Displays the number of data buffers that has actually been created.
If you want to change the number of buffers you must change cxOsNbBufs.
Range of Values: Depends on amount of installed system DRAM, as well as on
 requirements made by software during initialization."

 requirements made by software during initialization."
