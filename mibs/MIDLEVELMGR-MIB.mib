        DESCRIPTION
                "This field specifies the MIB variable or expression on which
                 thresholding is to be performed, in dotted numeric notation,
                 followed by an instance identifier.  For example, to perform
                 threshold checking mib-2.interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifInErrors
                 (object ID .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.14) for interface 1, this
                 field would contain .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.14.1.  To perform
                 threshold checking on all instances of a variable, an
                 asterisk can be used.  In the previous example, to perform
                 threshold checking on all interfaces, the object ID
                 .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.14.* would be entered.  The instance ID
                 can also be a non-numeric string, in which case each octet
                 in the string is converted to an object identifier.  For
                 example, to threshold on the smMlmSystemFileSystemPercentUsed
                 variable (object ID .1.3.6.1.4.1.2.6.12.2.5.2.1.4) for the
                 /usr directory, .1.3.6.1.4.1.2.6.12.2.5.2.1.4./usr would be
                 placed in this field since the Remote Manager filesystem
                 table uses the directory name as the index.  Most of the
                 tables supported by the Remote Manager use a name as an
                 index, so using the character form of the name provides a
                 simple way to specify an instance identifier.

                 Threshold MIB variable expressions can be any expression
                 comprised of local or remote node MIB variables with the
                 following high to low precedence and left to right associativity
                 of operators:

                     () : grouping
                     -  : unary minus
                     *  : multiplication, / : division, % : remainder
                     +  : addition, - : subtraction
                     << : bitwise left shift, >> : bitwise right shift
                     &  : bitwise AND
                     ^  : bitwise exclusive OR
                     |  : bitwise inclusive OR

                 Expression evaluation/operators are based on standard
                 c program execution.

                 Counter MIB variables default to the delta value, calculated
                 by subtracting the old MIB value from the current MIB value.
                 Integer and gauge MIB variables default to the current value
                 returned.  The two functions @delta() and @value() can be used
                 to override the above defaults.  Displaystrings can be converted
                 to a real value using the @delta() and @value() functions.

                 Built-in functions available within expressions include:

                     @sum(MIB variable expression, MIB variable expression, ...) -
                      returns the sum of all values.
                     @avg(MIB variable expression, MIB variable expression, ...) -
                      returns the average of all values.
                     @min(MIB variable expression, MIB variable expression, ...) -
                      returns the minimum of all values.
                     @max(MIB variable expression, MIB variable expression, ...) -
                      returns the maximum of all values.
                     @diff(MIB variable expression, MIB variable expression) -
                      returns the positive difference in the two expressions.
                     @delta(MIB variable expression) - uses the delta value
                      calculated by subtracting the last returned MIB variable
                      value from the current MIB variable value.  This function
                      can be used to force delta calculations on integer, gauge,
                      and displaystring MIB variables.
                     @value(MIB variable expression) - uses the current MIB
                      variable value.  This function can be used to force the
                      use of actual values for counter MIB variables.
                     @numInst(MIB variable expression) - returns the number
                      of instances found for the MIB variable expression.
                     @abs(MIB variable expression) - returns the positive
                       value of the expression.
                     @rand() - returns a random number between 0 and
                       42949667295.

                 The \ character can be used as an escape character in the
                 object ID to input the special character: period(.).  For
                 example: .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.14.1.\. replaces the \. with
                 the integer 46, the ASCII decimal value for period(.).

                 Agent Policy Manager (APM) uses the special string: {NV_x.x.x.x}
                 as part of the object ID and the periods within the string ARE
                 converted to the ASCII decimal value of 46.  In other words,
                 the periods are treated as characters instead of object ID
                 delimiters.

                 When using the Mid-Level Manager, if a name followed by a
                 colon is prepended to the object identifier, it is taken
                 to be an alias for a group of nodes (if defined in the Remote
                 Manager Alias Table) or the name of a remote node.  For
                 example, entering aixnm007:1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.14.* will cause
                 threshold checking to be performed on all instances of
                 ifInErrors on machine aixnm007.  If aixnm007 is defined in the
                 Alias Table as an alias for a group of machines, threshold
                 checking of these variables will be done for every machine in
                 the group."

smMlmThresholdCondition OBJECT-TYPE

        ACCESS  read-write
        STATUS  mandatory
        DESCRIPTION
                "Condition operation for the threshold value.

                      [type keyword] [statistics keyword] condition

                 Allowed conditions are: =, >, >=, >+, <, <=, <-, !=, !,
                 ~, ~=, !~, !~=, &, |, changes, doesNotChange, exists,
                 and doesNotExist.

                 The ~(LIKE) condition is for extended regular expression
                 checking on strings.  The style of the regular expression
                 is of the format for the ed or egrep command.  The ~(LIKE)
                 is case insensitive, while the ~=(LIKE CASE) is case sensitive.

                 The >+ and <- condition checks for a value increase(>+) above
                 or a value decrease(<-) below the threshold value on
                 consecutive polls.  Once the condition is met the rearm
                 condition is also checked on consecutive polls.

                 The change condition causes a watchdog operation to be
                 performed.  That is, if the value changes between
                 consecutive polls, the condition is satisfied.  (The
                 threshold value is ignored in this case).

                 Similarly, the exist/doesNotExist checks for the actual
                 existence of the MIB variable;  this is useful for
                 checking for the existence of rows in a table.

                 The & and | conditions cause the MIB variable value to
                 be ANDed/Ored with threshold value; if the result is
                 nonzero, the condition is met and the trap and/or
                 command to execute is performed.

                 NOTE: Thresholds for Counter variables are computed by
                 calculating the change(delta) in the sampled values and
                 comparing this against the threshold value.  In the case of
                 Gauge and INTEGER variables, the actual value of the
                 variable is checked against the threshold value.

                 The statistics keywords 'iMax', 'iMin', 'iAvg', 'iSd', 'iVar',
                 'iRate', 'Max', 'Min', 'Avg', 'Sd', and 'Var' if placed in
                 front of the condition (and separated from if by a space) allows
                 the use of the interval or lifetime maximum, minimum, average,
                 standard deviation, variance, and rate.  These values are
                 calculated for each MIB variable returned in the threshold.
                 For the interval keywords the sampling interval is defined
                 by the MIB variable: smMlmProgramControlSamplesPerInterval.
                 For example, if the smMlmProgramControlSamplesPerInterval is 10
                 then the 'iAvg' keyword is the average value of the last ten
                 samples returned to the threshold for each MIB value.

                 The type keywords 'delta' and 'value', if placed in front of the
                 condition or statistics keywords (and separated from it by
                 a space) will override this default behavior.  For example,
                 a condition of 'value >' will cause threshold checking to be
                 performed against the actual value rather than the change in
                 the value even if the selected MIB variable is a Counter; a
                 condition of 'delta >' causes the change in the variable
                 (from the previous value) to be checked against the threshold,
                 regardless of the type of the variable."

        STATUS  mandatory
        DESCRIPTION
                "Condition operation for the rearm threshold value.

                      [type keyword] [statistics keyword] condition

                 Allowed conditions are: =, >, >=, >+, <, <=, <-, !=, !,
                 ~, ~=, !~, !~=, &, |, changes, doesNotChange, exists,
                 and doesNotExist.

                 Checking against the rearm condition is started when a
                 threshold is reached and is stopped when the rearm condition
                 is met.  Once the rearm condition is met, the threshold
                 condition operation is restarted.

                 The ~(LIKE) condition is for extended regular expression
                 checking on strings.  The style of the regular expression
                 is of the format for the ed or egrep command.  The ~(LIKE)
                 is case insensitive, while the ~=(LIKE CASE) is case sensitive.

                 The >+ and <- condition checks for a value increase(>+) above
                 or a value decrease(<-) below the threshold value on
                 consecutive polls.  Once the condition is met the arm
                 condition is also checked on consecutive polls.

                 NOTE: Thresholds for Counter variables are computed by
                 calculating the change per second in the sampled values and
                 comparing these against the threshold value.  In the case of
                 Gauge and INTEGER variables, the actual value of the variable
                 is checked against the threshold value.

                 The statistics keywords 'iMax', 'iMin', 'iAvg', 'iSd', 'iVar',
                 'iRate', 'Max', 'Min', 'Avg', 'Sd', and 'Var' if placed in
                 front of the condition (and separated from if by a space) allows
                 the use of the interval or lifetime maximum, minimum, average,
                 standard deviation, variance, and rate.  These values are
                 calculated for each MIB variable returned in the threshold.
                 For the interval keywords the sampling interval is defined
                 by the MIB variable: smMlmProgramControlSamplesPerInterval.
                 For example, if the smMlmProgramControlSamplesPerInterval is 10
                 then the 'iAvg' keyword is the average value of the last ten
                 samples returned to the threshold for each MIB value.

                 The type keywords 'delta' and 'value', if placed in front of the
                 condition or statistics keywords (and separated from it by
                 a space) will override this default behavior.  For example,
                 a condition of 'value >' will cause threshold checking to be
                 performed against the actual value rather than the change in
                 the value even if the selected MIB variable is a Counter; a
                 condition of 'delta >' causes the change in the variable
                 (from the previous value) to be checked against the threshold,
                 regardless of the type of the variable."

               "This field specifies the value against which retrieved
                variables are checked.  The type of check which is done
                depends on the type of the retrieved variable.  If the
                variable is numeric (INTEGER, Counter, etc.) this field is
                presumed to be a number, and a numeric comparison is performed
                using the specified threshold condition.  If the retrieved
                variable is a DisplayString (OCTET STRING) and the 'value'
                keyword is used on the condition then both the
                retrieved variable and this field can be converted to a
                floating point number, a floating-point comparison is done;
                otherwise a string comparison is done.

	        If the ~(LIKE) or ~=(LIKE CASE) condition is used then
                the value can be an extended regular expression.

                A value expression is also allowed to be specified.  The
                expression can be any expression comprised of the following
                functions:

                   'Min'   - lifetime minimum    'iMin'   - interval minimum

                   'Var'   - lifetime variance   'iVar'   - interval variance
                   'Smpls' - lifetime samples    'iSmpls' - interval samples
                   'sTime' - sample time in secs 'iTime'  - interval time in secs
                                                 'iRate'  - rate of change over the
                                                            interval
                 The interval is defined by the MIB variable:
                 smMlmProgramControlSamplesPerInterval.

                 The expression has the following high to low precedence and left
                 to right associativity of operators:

                     () : grouping
                     -  : unary minus
                     *  : multiplication, / : division, % : remainder
                     +  : addition, - : subtraction

                 Expression evaluation/operators are based on standard
                 c program execution.

                 For example: Avg+2*Sd is the average value over the
                              lifetime of the threshold plus two times
                              the standard deviation."

                "This field is used to match trap against the
                 environment variables, set on the basis of MIB variables
                 and other information flowing in the trap.

                 The expression can be any expression with left operand as
                 environment variable name( prepended with $) and right operand
                 as values of variables or regular expression, with
                 the following operators:

                     () : grouping
                     && : logical and
                     || : logical or
                     == : equal to
                     != : not equal to

                     >= : greater than equal to
                     !  : negation

                 The precedence and associativity of operators is
                 same as in c language and expression evaluation
                 is based on standard c program execution.

                 Set of environment variables that can be used in
                 the expression are:

                 number in the trap (starting at 1).

                 Values can be in the form of integer, dot notation or string
                 or hex string.
                 If it is a string it should be within quotes.

                 Format of regular expression is: RE:expression (within
                 double quotes), where 'expression' is the extended regular
                 expression in the style of ed or egrep command.

                   example:

                   Check for trap number 22 from System Information Agent.

                   If the expression evaluates to TRUE, then the

                "This field specifies the command to execute when the throttle

                   2)  the smMlmFilterThrottleDisarmTimer has expired.

                 NOTE: If the above mentioned timer expires and the throttle
                       is NOT currently ARMED, the throttle is reset, but
                       this disarm command is NOT executed.  So, the disarm
                       command is only executed if the throttle is armed
                       before being disarmed.

                 A set of environment variables are defined that contain

                 The following environment variables pertain to the received

                     |  : bitwise inclusive OR

                 Expression evaluation/operators are based on standard
                 c program execution.

                 Counter MIB variables default to the delta value, calculated
                 by subtracting the old MIB value from the current MIB value.
                 Integer and gauge MIB variables default to the current value
                 returned.  The two functions @delta() and @value() can be used
                 to override the above defaults.  Displaystrings can be converted
                 to a real value using the @delta() and @value() functions.

                 Built-in functions available within expressions include:

                     @sum(MIB variable expression, MIB variable expression, ...) -
                      returns the sum of all values.
                     @avg(MIB variable expression, MIB variable expression, ...) -
                      returns the average of all values.
                     @min(MIB variable expression, MIB variable expression, ...) -
                      returns the minimum of all values.
                     @max(MIB variable expression, MIB variable expression, ...) -
                      returns the maximum of all values.
                     @diff(MIB variable expression, MIB variable expression) -
                      returns the positive difference in the two expressions.
                     @delta(MIB variable expression) - uses the delta value
                      calculated by subtracting the last returned MIB variable
                      value from the current MIB variable value.  This function
                      can be used to force delta calculations on integer, gauge,
                      and displaystring MIB variables.
                     @value(MIB variable expression) - uses the current MIB
                      variable value.  This function can be used to force the
                      use of actual values for counter MIB variables.
                     @numInst(MIB variable expression) - returns the number
                      of instances found for the MIB variable expression.
                     @abs(MIB variable expression) - returns the positive
                       value of the expression.
                     @rand() - returns a random number between 0 and
                       42949667295.

                 To use remote MIB variables, the alias name, host name, or
                 IP address can be pre-appended to the MIB variable binding.
                 Also, the object ID can accept a wildcard value (*).

                 When MIB variables resolve to multiple values or nodes
                 outside of the built-in functions, all resolved values
                 are averaged before use in the expression.  For example,
                 routers:.1.2.3.4.5.0/100, would result in the averaging
                 of all values returned for this aliased MIB variable
                 before the division by 100 operation is performed."
