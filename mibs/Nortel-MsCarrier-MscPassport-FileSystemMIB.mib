-- FILESYSTEM
-- The Filesystem component provides and controls access to files and 
-- directories stored on one or two disks. It is automatically created 
-- and always present.
-- 
-- The Filesystem restricts files and directories names to 40 characters. 
-- It also restricts filenames including path to 128 characters. 
-- Directory names including the path cannot exceed 125 characters. 
-- There must be 112 or less directories and files at the root level. The 
-- maximum hierarchy depth is 10 directory levels. 
-- The only characters that can appear in a filename are the alpha-
-- numeric characters, the . (dot) and the _ (underscore). The names 
-- are case sensitive. A pathname is a sequence of zero to ten directory 
-- names along the path and separated by the / (slash) character. A 
-- pathname that begins with a slash is an absolute pathname, 
-- otherwise it is a relative pathname. Access to the standby disk is not 
-- allowed. 
-- 
-- When there are two disks, the standby control processor disk is 
-- normally synchronized with the disk of the active control processor. 
-- After a crash or a disk failure the standby control processor disk 
-- becomes unsynchronized with respect to the disk on the active CP.
