-- Based on Network Address Client (NAC) MIB file, mcmnac.mib (access device Rlse 1.1), 
-- and Remote Server Interface (RSI) Design Document (Rev 1.4, dated 4/30/97).
-- 
-- MIB Revision : 1.0 dated 6-3-97
-- Change Desc. : Initial submittal - R. Carmona. 
-- 
-- MIB Revision : 1.1 dated 7-15-97
-- Change Desc. : Changed RSI Cache table, mcmRSICacheCfgTable, CAPABILITIES
--		  field declaration to 'NET_DISP, VPN_DISP'.  Purpose is to
--		  disable user capability to add 'static' RSI Cache entries
--		  to table for 4400 2.0 as per e-mail from P. Lupo, 7/11/97.
--		  'Static' entries may still be 'hard coded' by software
--		  developer (for test purposes) and these entries may still
--		  be read by a user from the RSI Cache table.
--
-- MIB Revision : 1.2 dated 7-24-97
-- Change Desc. : Changed SIZE range of Server Name and CUGIC fields to allow
--		  for null strings as per e-mail from P. Lupo on 7/23/97.
--		  (Allows the user to not configure these objects for an
--		  existing row in the RSI Server tables.)  -R. Carmona
--
-- MIB Revision : 1.3 dated 10-10-97
-- Change Desc. : Changed MPA to 4400, and deleted the 
--                'mcmRSICacheCfgEntryRowStatus' object based on mutual
--                agreement with Paul Lupo, plus other minor changes - B. Jafari.
--
-- MIB Revision : 1.4 dated 10-27-97
-- Change Desc. : Several modifications based on pre-release development
--                requirements, including deletion of redundant objects,
--                and minor syntax corrections. - B. Jafari
--               
-- MIB Revision : 1.5 Dated 10-30-97
-- Change Desc. : Removed mcmRSIServerUsageStatus object from the mcmRSIServer
--		  table. - K. Yeh
--               
-- MIB Revision : 1.6 Dated 11-25-97
-- Change Desc. : Removed all remaining references to static entries throughout
--		  the MIB and deleted the nvmRSICacheCfgTable. - B. Jafari
--
-- MIB Revision : 1.7 Dated 2-23-98
-- Change Desc. : Added mcmRSIServerDNAAddr to the varbind list for 
--		  mcmAlarmRsiRSAIsDown and mcmAlarmRsiRSAIsUp.
--
-- *** RELEASE 3.0 ***
-- MIB Revision : 1.8 dated 6-24-98
-- Change Desc. : Removed and/or replaced "4400" with 
--				  "access device" wherever possible.
--				  Added the enumeration "active" and
--				  changed the access to read-write for
--				  the row status object, nvmRSIServerEntryRowStatus 
--				  Obsoleted the counter reset object,
--				  mcmRSICounterResetCmd. -A. Llanes 
--
-- MIB Revision : 1.9 dated 11-02-98
-- Change Desc. : Add Severity Levels to Traps.
