        MAX-ACCESS  not-accessible
        STATUS      current
        DESCRIPTION "This table can have a variable number of
                    entries(rows), containing cross-connect
                    parameters as seen from this side of the 
                    cross-connect. 

                    When started for the very first time
                    this table is empty (has no rows present).

                    SNMP manager actions are required to
                    create or delete rows in the table.

                    One row typically represents a cross-connect,
                    as seen from this side of cross-connect.

                    Once created, a row is saved in non-volatile
                    memory, and is guarantied to persist after
                    card/shelf reset or a redundant switchover
                    occurs.

                    The lumTdmConnectionStatus object is used
                    to control the process of dynamic row
                    creation and removal as described in RFC2579.
                    Luminous specific adaptation of RFC2579
                    RowStatus convention follows:

                    - To create a new cross-connect an SNMP
                        Manager must in the one SNMP SET request
                        supply not yet existing instances of at
                        least those read-create objects that
                        have no DEFVAL clause specified.
                        The lumTdmConnectionStatus object's
                        instance value MUST be either 
                        createAndGo(4) or createAndWait(5).
                        If the row does not already exist
                        and request is accepted, the SNMP Agent
                        will respond with positive response
                        where it will set the value of
                        lumTdmConnectionStatus instance equal to
                        active(1) or notInService(2) respectfully.

                    - SNMP Manager is allowed to change existing
                        cross-connect from active(1) to 
                        notInService(2) and vice versa.

                    - To remove cross-connect completely an SNMP
                        Manager must in one SNMP SET request
                        supply desired instance of 
                        lumTdmConnectionStatus with the value of
                        destroy(6). "
