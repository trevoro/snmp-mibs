	"An enumeration describing a type of Policy attribute 
	supported by this device.
	This Policy attribute's semantics is intended to make sense 
	within the context of the CajunRules application. At this 
	time, a value of 'ldap' indicates that the device
	is retrieving policy information from an LDAP server. 
	This implies that the device also implements the LDAP Group 
	defined in this MIB.

	At this time the other enumerations are informational only 
	and are intended for future enhancements.

	It should be noted that 'snmp' indicates that the policies 
	themselves are being set by SNMP. The implementation of the 
	producer/consumer handshake defined in this MIB
	in the LDAP group does NOT require the 
	lucentDevicePolicyCapabilityType to be set to 'snmp'. 

	The value 'cli' is intended for a proprietary implementation 
	of cli functionality implemented over some proprietary port. 
	This value does NOT refer to the device's implementation of a 
	local command line interface or a command line interface
	supported over a telnet interface."
