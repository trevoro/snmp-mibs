SeeAppProfile ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS current
    DESCRIPTION
            "This TC describes an enumerated integer that identifies an
            individual application profile.

            The value 'appWatchedVar' indicates the Watched Variable
            application profile, which allows a script to be executed if
            instances of a polled MIB object changes value.

            The value 'appPeriodic' indicates the Periodic application
            profile, which allows a script to be executed repeatedly,
            once per specified polling interval.

            The value 'appCalendar' indicates the Calendar application
            profile, which allows a script to be executed on an ad-hoc
            basis, with the Scheduling MIB.

            The value 'appNotifyFilter' indicates the Notification
            Filter application profile, which allows a script to be
            executed just before particular notifications are generated
            by the SNMP Entity hosting the script execution environment.
            The value 'appNotifyReceiver' indicates the Notification
            Receiver application profile, which allows a script to be
            executed when particular notifications are received by the
            SNMP Entity hosting the script execution environment.

            The value 'appVirtualGet' indicates the Virtual Get
            application profile, which allows a read-only script to be
            executed if an associated MIB object is retrieved by a
            command generator application.

            The value 'appManual' indicates this the Manual application
            profile, which allows a script to be executed by management
            application action only."

            If the 'agentEnvVars' BIT is set, then this task may create
            and destroy environment variables with agent scope.

            If the 'groupEnvVars' BIT is set, then this task may create
            and destroy environment variables with group scope, and only
            for the group identified by the associated
            seeTaskControlGroupId object.

            If the 'taskEnvVars' BIT is set, then this task may create
            and destroy environment variables with group scope, and only
            for this task, identified by the associated
            seeTaskControlTaskIndex object.

            If the 'notificationPDUs' BIT is set, and the application
            profile for this entry permits notification generation, then
            this task may emit notifications via the 'SnmpMsgLib' system
            library functions.

            If the 'getPDUs' BIT is set, then this task may conduct SNMP
            data retrieval transactions via the 'SnmpMsgLib' system
            library functions.

            If the 'setPDUs' BIT is set, then this task may conduct SNMP
            Set transactions via the system library functions.

            If the 'writeConfig' BIT is set, and write access is
            permitted by the application profile for this entry, then
            this task may call system library functions which
            (potentially) change configuration parameters in the host
            SNMP engine.

            If the 'diagnostics' BIT is set, and write access is
            permitted by the application profile for this entry, then
            this task may call system library functions which invoke
            (potentially intrusive) diagnostics tests on the host SNMP
            engine.

            If the 'oidAlias' BIT is set, and write access is permitted
            by the application profile for this entry, then this task
            may call system library functions which create, delete, or

    DESCRIPTION
            "This TC describes a string that represents a globally
            unique data type identifier string.  The agent uses this
            string for type conversion and data validation purposes
            within the execution environment.

            This is a case-sensitive string that is not null-terminated.
            It must contain the name of a base data type from the
            SMIv2-SMI, or a base data type from the SEE language.

            The intrinsic Type Identifier 'Null' is used to
            differentiate between an empty string and an unset string.
            There are three 'read-only' variants of the 'Null' Type
            Identifier, which may be present in Response PDU varbind
            lists to clarify the semantics of a zero length value
            string:

              'NoSuchName'

            semantics to be shared by multiple objects.  The enumeration
            'noError' has been changed from the value '1' to the value
            '0' to be consistent with the C programming language. The
            value '1' as been changed to 'notSet'. An additional
            enumeration (triggerOverflowError) has also been added.

            An object of this type may have one of the following values:

            - `noError', which indicates that the script or function
               completed successfully without errors;

            - `notSet', which does not indicate any error condition;

               function exited because it ran out of resources,
               (e.g. memory);

               function exited because of a language error (e.g. a
               syntax error in an interpreted language);

            - `runtimeError', which indicates that the script or
               function exited due to a runtime error (e.g. a
               division by zero);

            - `invalidArgument', which indicates that the script or

               invocation of that task was already in progress, and

    DESCRIPTION
            "Contains the environment variable definitions used on this
            SEE agent. An environment variable is represented as an
            array of 'STRING' data elements.  The number of strings is
            identified by the seeEnvVarArraySize object (in this table)
            and the maximum size of each string is identified by the
            seeCapsMaxEnvStringLen scalar object.

            The SEE agent will recognize the SeeIdentifierString
            specified in each entry as an environment variable array
            identifier token with the same value.

            The indexing of this table allows three different scopes in
            which a given environment variable may be visible - agent,
            group, and task.

                 INVALID     non-zero              non-zero

                Agent Scope: 1 instance of the env var per agent
                Group Scope: 1 instance of the env var per group
                Task Scope:  1 instance of the env var per task

            When a task requests access to an environment variable (via
            the 'EnvVarLib' System Library), the agent will determine
            the proper identifier scope by searching this table for the
            correct task, group, or agent scoped entry.
            The binding between management task and the proper set of
            environment variables is done (conceptually) just before
            each invocation of the associated script.

            Applications should not delete entries which are currently
            in use by one or more seeTaskControlEntries."

    DESCRIPTION
            "Controls the manner in which the script associated with
            this task is executed.  There are four run modes defined,
            which allow some level of control over log messages, script
            debugging, and system access.

            The value 'normalRunMode' identifies a management task
            running in the 'normal' operational mode, in which system
            library function logging is disabled.  Note that a script
            may emit logging messages via library functions, regardless
            of the value of this object.  This mode only disables trace
            logging of system activity.

            The value 'traceRunMode' identifies a management task
            running in the 'trace' operational mode, in which system
            activity, such as calls to library functions, are logged in
            the seeLogControlTable.

            The value 'debugRunMode' identifies a management task
            running in the 'debug' operational mode, in which trace
            logging is active, except no read-write library functions
            are actually invoked. This allows an administrator some
            ability to determine the impact of a new script on the
            existing environment, without risking system disruption.
            Note that scripts which modify and then inspect system
            behavior may behave unexpectedly in this 'no-op' run mode.

            The value 'validateMode' identifies a management task that
            is installed in validation mode.  Instead of executing the
            associated script, the agent will examine the entire script
            for correctness.  Problems such as syntax errors and
            unresolved function names should be detected in this mode.
            Note that an implementation cannot completely validate OID
            Alias and environment variable identifier usage, since these
            identifier tokens can be installed dynamically, by scripts
            or management applications.

            After the validation check is done, the
            seeTaskControlLastResCode, seeTaskControlLastSEIndex, and
            seeTaskControlLastSEOffset objects will be set to non-zero
            values if any problems are found.  The agent will also
            output error messages to the seeLogTable for the script.
