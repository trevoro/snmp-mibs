      In an unstructured service, the entire data stream at the service

      The unstructured service uses the Unstructured Data Transfer

      the service interface is passed across the network. Two modes of 
      structured service are supported: basicStructured and casStructured. 
      In a casStructured service, the Channel Associated Signalling 
      (CAS) bits are carried in a separate data structure from the Nx64 
      payload; in a basicStructured service they are not.
      
      The structured service uses the Structured Data Transfer (SDT) 
      mode as defined in ITU-T Recommendation I.363.1.

   DESCRIPTION
     "On 4pDS1Aal1 and 4pE1Aal1 cards, this attribute specifies the size 
      of the AAL1 receive segment reassembly buffer in bytes. On 
      initialization the buffer is filled to a level determined by 
      cellDelayVariationTolerance. Thereafter the buffer is emptied as 
      TDM frames are transmitted, and is filled as ATM cells are 
      received. If the buffer overflows, sufficient data is discarded to bring 
      the level down to that set after initialization. The cause of a buffer 
      overflow may be one or a combination of any of the following: cell-
      arrival-jitter, initialization with delayed ATM cells, or TDM clock 
      difference or wander. 
      
      On 4pDS1Aal1 and 4pE1Aal1 cards, if this attribute is 
      autoConfigure, the buffer size applied is equivalent to two times 
      cellDelayVariationTolerance. A provisioned numeric value of 
      bufferSize must be higher than the equivalent 
      cellDelayVariationTolerance, plus an allowance of one ATM Cell 
      for the quantization of data in cells, and an allowance, if applicable, 
      for the ATM overheads of structured CES.
      
      On MSA cards this attribute's value must be autoConfigure, to 
      acknowledge that maximumBufferDelay is provisioned instead of 
      this attribute.
      
      Setting this attribute too low allows traffic with normal CDV to 
      cause unnecessary loss of data on the service interface. Setting this 
      attribute too high permits the buffer to introduce an unnecessarily 
      high propagation delay.

      partial fill level).
      
      This attribute specifies the number of payload octets to fill with 
      data. It is applicable to structured services only, and must be set to 
      47 for unstructured services.
      
      On a given AAL1 Function Processor, the maximum cell rate that 
      can be sustained is dependent upon the combined bandwidths of the 
      provisioned services, and (for structured services) the levels of 
      partialFill. The smaller the partialFill level, the greater the cell rate

      The strategy is as follows: the first idle cell after a sequence of non-

      however, that at least one cell in eight is always sent (to allow the 
      receive end to regenerate the suppressed cells) and more often than

   ACCESS     read-write
   STATUS     mandatory
   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute specifies the maximum delay that a Cell Delay 
      Variation buffer is permitted to add to the egress stream. The delay 
      in the buffer is modified in response to variation in the egress cell 
      stream. At the point that the delay would be modified in excess of 
      the maximum, sufficient data is discarded that the delay returns to 
      cellDelayVariationTolerance.
      
      Setting this attribute too low allows traffic with normal CDV to 
      cause unnecessary loss of data on the service interface. Setting this 
      attribute too high permits the buffer to introduce an unnecessarily 
      high propagation delay.
      
      If this attribute is autoConfigure, the maximum delay tolerated in 
      the buffer is two times cellDelayVariationTolerance. On MSA 
      cards, 'best-effort' applies on a channel with high 
      cellDelayVariationTolerance and low ATM bandwidth. The value 
      applied is the same as the range limit on provisioned 
      maximumBufferDelay on that channel.
      
      On MSA cards this attribute's value is rounded up to the nearest 
      multiple of 0.125ms when applied to the buffer. The range is 
      nominally 0.12..63.62ms, but the upper limit may be reduced by up 
      to 6ms one a channel with high cellDelayVariationTolerance and 
      low ATM bandwidth.
      
      On 4pDS1Aal1 and 4pE1Aal1 cards this attribute's value is rounded 
      up to the nearest multiple of 1ms when applied to the buffer. The 
      upper limit is roughly inverse- proportional to the ATM bandwidth 
      of the channel.

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute specifies the maximum time that a cell may arrive 
      late, compared to a nominal time established at buffer initialization, 
      without producing errors on the service interface. The nominal time 
      of a cell's arrival is predicted according to the time interval required 
      to transmit a cell's worth of data on the service interface.
      
      This attribute's value is the delay that the Cell Delay Variation 
      Tolerance buffer adds to the egress stream immediately after the 
      buffer initializes. The buffer absorbs variation in the arrival time of 
      cells from the network, so that a steady stream of data appears on 
      the service interface. If the buffer underflows, due to a late cell, fill-
      in data is output on the service interface while the buffer re-
      initializes. When the buffer has re-initialized, normal data is output 
      on the service interface and the delay in the buffer is restored to the 
      value of this attribute.
      
      This attribute must have a value lower than a numeric value of 
      maximumBufferDelay. The relationship between this attribute and 
      bufferSize is described under that attribute.
      
      Setting this attribute too low allows traffic with normal CDV to 
      cause unnecessary loss of data on the service interface. Setting this 
      attribute too high imposes an unnecessarily high propagation delay 
      on the egress stream.
      
      On MSA cards this attribute's provisionable range is 0.01..32ms and 
      the value applied is rounded up to the nearest multiple of 0.125ms.
      
      On 4pDS1Aal1 and 4pE1Aal1 cards, this attribute's provisionable 
      range is strongly dependent on the bandwidth of the channel, and 
      the value applied is rounded up to the nearest whole number of 
      milliseconds, then rounded down to the equivalent number of cells."

-- The ActiveEndPoint component will make connection setup 
-- attempts periodically whenever a connection has not been 
-- established. The component will cease connection setup attempts 
-- after a number of consecutive failed attempts, as specified by the 
-- retryLimit attribute.
-- 
-- The ActiveEndPoint component may also accept an incoming setup 
-- request if a connection is not already established. To be accepted, an 
-- incoming connection setup request must have originated from

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute indicates whether the path for this PLC was 
      determined automatically or by static provisioning. Normal 
      pathTypes are selected automatically by Route Selector.The other 
      pathTypes are both manual pathTypes where the operator must 
      specify, through provisioning, a static route termed the manualPath. 
      A manual pathType connection is nearly identical to a normal path 
      type connection with the exception that the route is pre-provisioned. 
      For a manual pathType, bandwidth reservations are respected along 
      the path exactly as in a normal path. The last type, the forced 
      pathType, is also a manual path but regardless of the bandwidth 
      available the route is granted provided the trunks are operational 
      and there are sufficient Logical Channels (LChs).
      
      The forced pathType could result in over committing the reserved 
      bandwidth allowed on a trunk. A better way to achieve the effects of 
      a forced pathType is to use a manual pathType with setupPriority = 
      0 and holdingPriority = 0. In this manner the path will reserve 
      correct bandwidth and it will bump other paths if required while not 
      being bumped itself."

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute reflects the last tear down reason for a connection 
      (LCo). In many cases this displays the reason for a momentary 
      service interruption. This attribute applies to the last path failure 
      only. If a path is no longer up, this may give an indication to the 
      reason that the path has failed. In many cases an alarm will also be 
      generated with more specific information. The following is a brief 
      description of the reasons:
      none - This path has no information for the teardown this is typical 
      of a path provisioned with no remoteName that has not been up.
      normalShutDown - This path has gone down due to normal call 
      termination.
      insufficientTxLcOrBandwidth - At present there is either no 
      available bandwidth or logical channel numbers available on one or 
      more of the trunks for this path in the transmit direction.
      insufficientRxLcOrBandwidth - At present there is either no 
      available bandwidth or logical channel numbers available on one or 
      more of the trunks for this path in the receive direction.
      trunkFailure- A trunk on the path has failed or has gone down due 
      to a provisioning change of a critical attribute.
      trunkCardFailure- A trunk FP card has failed along the path.
      accessCardFailure- The FP on which the peer access service was 
      running has failed.
      operatorForced- The path has terminated due to the operator 
      locking a trunk along the path.
      lostLcnClash- The path has terminated because the PA's at both 
      ends of an intermediate trunk have allocated the same LC to 
      different calls. When this happens both calls must go down and then 
      try to come up again a fraction of a second later (effectively 
      ensuring that they will now be assigned different LC's). It is normal 
      to get the odd clash especially when the PA's usedLC is 
      approaching the PA's maxLC.
      networkCongestion - The path has failed due to control information 
      being lost and not recoverable.
      trunkNotFound - Occurs on a manual path usually. Check for 
      trunks not up or names provisioned incorrectly.
      farEndNotFound - The far end is not provisioned or is not up. 
      Check remote Name.
      wrongModuleReached - This may occur on a manual path. Check 
      provisioning for correct trunk and service names. For a normal 
      path, the network Topology may be changing check remoteName.
      farEndBusy - The far end has been reached but it is busy. Check 
      remoteName and remote end provisioning.
      callLoopedBack - This LCo is provisioned to call itself. Re-
      provision since this is invalid.
      unknownReason - The failure was not resolved.
      farEndNotReady - The remote end was reached but the connection 
      was refused due to the remote end not being enabled.
      remoteNameMismatch - The remote end has alarmed and rejected 
      this setup due to remoteName provisioning.
      serviceTypeMismatch - The remote Service Type does not match 
      this service type. Check provisioning.
      reconnectFromFarEnd - The remote end re-established this 
      connection. Check the remote end lastTearDownReason to 
      determine the real reason.
      bumped - Another call bumped this path from a trunk to get 
      bandwidth (or an LC) which it required to come up. This other path 
      had a higher setupPriority than this path's holdingPriority hence it 
      was allowed to steal the bandwidth (or LC) from this path.
      optimized - This call has been rerouted due to the optimization 
      feature. The call is still active this just indicates why the path 
      changed.
      trunkOrFarEndDidNotSupportMode - This call was unable to 
      complete because a mode required by the service was not supported 
      by one of the trunks the route went through or by the far end service 
      it connected to. Currently the only mode that this applies to is the 
      map/mux mode on TRUNK PA ATM component. Map mode was 
      required by the application (CES/FrAtm etc.) but was not available 
      on the TRUNK PA ATM component through which the call was 
      routed or the far end CES/FrAtm component did not specify the 
      same mode."

      displays reRoutePath, the path may attempt an immediate reroute, 
      provided the failure is a recoverable failure. If rerouting fails the 
      application is informed of the failure. 
      With this option set to reRoutePath the LCo may wait up to 30 
      seconds before informing the service of complete disconnection in 
      order to allow both ends to attempt to reconnect. Note that if PLC 
      components are different at both ends only the calling end is

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute indicates whether a service is non-operational because 
      of a problem with the service interface side of the service (in which 
      case, it is set to channelNotReady) or because of a problem with the 
      ATM side of the service (in which case, it is set to 
      atmNotConfigured or atmNotReady).
      
      When this attribute is set to channelNotReady, it is an indication 
      that the corresponding Chan component (as defined by the attribute 
      interfaceName) or the Chan component's parent port component 
      (Lp/n Ds1/m or Lp/n E1/m) is locked.
      
      When this attribute is set to atmNotConfigured, it is an indication 
      that no sub-component has been provisioned, and thus no ATM 
      connection has been configured for the service.
      
      When this attribute is set to atmNotReady, it is an indication that the 
      ATM connection with which the service is associated (as defined by 
      a sub-component) has been lost or that it is currently unable to carry 
      CES data.
      
      When this attribute is set to channelNotSpecified, it is an indication 
      that the chanToMonitor attribute is not set to a valid channel.
      
      This attribute is set to connected when a service is operational (that 
      is, the OSI attribute operationalState is enabled.)"
