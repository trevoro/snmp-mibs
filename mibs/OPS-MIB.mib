       DESCRIPTION
           "This is the MIB module for OPS-compliant
           CPE for managing configurations of

   --
   -- The Open Provisioning Standard (OPS) MIB defines managed objects
   -- for flow-though provisioning and management functions. This
   -- document defines two groups of management objects for
   -- next-generation customer premise equipment (NG-CPE). The first
   -- group of objects are of a general configuration nature.
   -- The second group of objects are similar to the Analog Line
   -- Termination objects of a GR-303 Remote Terminal as defined in
   -- the GR-303-Core document. A NG-CPE that implements the
   -- OPS MIB is an OPS compliant NG-CPE (OPS-CPE).
   --
   -- The network management systems at the Network Operation Center
   -- (NOC) perform flow-through provisioning and management of
   -- OPS-IADs through an OPS-compliant Multi-Service Access
   -- Concentrator (MAS).

           In order for the IAD to come up with the new system image
           the next time it is rebooted, the network manager must set

           For IADs that can contain multiple configuration files,

           2) When the 'save' option is specified, the IAD will
           continue to use the currently running configuration file.
           In order for the IAD to use the newly downloaded
           configuration file, the network manager should set
           the 'iOpsIADConfigFileName' object-type with the newly
           downloaded configuration file name, and then set the
           'iOpsIADReConfigIAD' object-type to the value

           3) When 'saveAndReconfigure' is specified, the IAD will

           - The file transfer successfully completed, AND
           - The file is not corrupt
