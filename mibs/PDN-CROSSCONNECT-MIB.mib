-- The Paradyne Channel Configuration group.
-- Release: 0.0.2 (6/27/96) DRAFT
-- 

-- Implementation of the Channel Configuration group is mandatory
-- for all Paradyne products capable of cross connecting between
-- multiple interfaces.  These objects allow the SNMP management
-- system to 1) display the DS0 channel assignment for the network or
-- DSX-1 Drop/Insert (if available) T1 interfaces, 2) allocate DS0
-- channels on the DSX-1 Drop/Insert interface to the network interface,
-- 3) allocate DS0 channels on the network or DSX-1 Drop/Insert T1
-- interfaces to particular synchronous data or voice ports, and
-- 4) assign a synchronous data port to another synchronous data port.
--
-- This group consists of two tables:
--
--    (1)  DS1 Fractional Table
--         (provides DS0 channel viewing and assignment between
--          T1 interfaces, and to synchronous data or voice ports)
--    (2)  Synchronous Data Port Assignment Table
--         (provides data port to data port assignment and viewing)

-- The Paradyne DS1 Fractional Table.

-- The DS1 Fractional Group in the DS1/E1 MIB (RFC 1406) only
-- allowed specification of an entire interface to a particular
-- time slot on another interface (i.e., a time slot on one
-- interface could not be mapped to a time slot on another
-- interface).  This caused the convention of mapping time
-- slots between channelized T1 interfaces to occur in 
-- ascending order.

-- This table allows the complete mapping of time slots on the
-- DSX-1 Drop/Insert T1 interface to time slots on the network
-- T1 interface.  In addition, time slots on either the DSX-1
-- or network T1 interface can be mapped to a synchronous data port
-- or to a voice port using this table.

-- It is important to note that when requesting a new connection,
-- all the necessary information used to specify a valid connection
-- must be included in the same SET PDU (i.e., multiple bindings
-- may be necessary).
--
-- In the case of assigning a DS0 channel between T1 interfaces,
-- two variable bindings are required in the SET PDU in order to
-- specify the entire valid connection (i.e., one binding to set
-- devDs1FracIfIndex, and one to set devDs1FracIfFracNumber).
--
-- However, in the case of assigning a DS0 channel to a synchronous
-- data port (or a voice port), only one binding is necessary (i.e.,
-- setting devDs1FracIfFracNumber is not manatory).
-- In addition, the allocation method (devSyncDataPortConfigAllocMethod)
-- must be set previously or included in the same SET PDU for this
-- assignment if the user wishes to use a value other than what is
-- currently set for the data port.  The same is true for the data 
-- port rate (devSyncDataPortConfigRate) in the case of assignment by
-- block, or ACAMI.

-- When the user specifies a valid connection, the unit completes
-- the connection for both directions simultaneously.  For example,
-- the SET PDU contains the information for connecting time slot 2 of
-- the DSX-1 interface to time slot 5 of the network T1 interface.  The
-- unit automatically sets up the connection for the 1) DSX-1 to network,
-- and 2) network to DSX-1 directions.

-- The Paradyne Synchronous Data Port Assignment Table.

-- This table is used to assign a synchronous data port to another
-- synchronous data port.  Assigning a synchronous data port to
-- another synchronous data port allows the feature of a backup port.
-- The user can attach an external backup device to the port and
-- manually assign the selected port to the backup port (i.e.,
-- route data from the selected port to the backup port).

-- It is important to note that when requesting a new connection,
-- all the necessary information used to specify a valid connection
-- must be included in the same SET PDU (i.e., multiple bindings
-- may be necessary).
-- During the assignment, both synchronous data ports must be at the same
-- port rate.  If the rate is not already the same for both ports,
-- it must be included in the SET PDU (i.e., one binding to set
-- devSyncDataPortAssignRate, and one to set
-- devSyncDataPortAssignIfIndex).

-- When the user specifies a valid assignment, the unit completes
-- the connection for both directions simultaneously.  For example,
-- the SET PDU contains the information for connecting synchronous
-- data port 1 to synchronous data port 3.  The unit automatically
-- assigns 1) synchronous data port 1 to sunchronous data port 3,
-- and 2) synchronous data port 3 to synchronous data port 1.

-- When connecting a synchronous data port to another synchronous
-- data port, the ports must have compatible base data rates in
-- order for the assignment to be accepted.  If the embedded data
-- link (EDL) is enabled for either port, the functionality associated
-- with the EDL feature is ignored.
