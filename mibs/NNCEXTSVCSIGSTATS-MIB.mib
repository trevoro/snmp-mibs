       STATUS messages received(transmitted), that contain
       any of the Cause values listed below.

     - Ignored messages. These messages are dropped because
       the message was so damaged that it could not be
       further processed. A list of dropped mesages is
       compiled below:
       
       1. Message with invalid protocol discriminator
       
       2. Message with errors in the call reference I.E.
          - Bits 5-8 of the first octet not equal to '0000'

     This counter counts the number of received(transmitted) 
     cause codes which do not belong to any of the predefined 
     cause codes groups during the time period of the interval.
     A 'response to STATUS ENQUIRY' cause code do not indicate 
     a failure condition and should not be counted.

    STATUS    current
    DESCRIPTION
    "Active calls gauge. This gauge represents the total number of
     incoming and outgoing calls which are currently active. The
     active call is defined here as the call which has been initialized
     with the SETUP message but not released with RELEASE or RELEASE
     COMPLETE messages. Therefore all the call states except for a
     Null state correspond to the active call."
    SYNTAX    Gauge32

  NncExtSelectiveCallsType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS    current
    DESCRIPTION
    "Incoming/outgoing selective calls counter. This counter counts

--
-- Outcome
--
-- It was the consensus of the review team that this file is acceptable 
-- with the indicated modifications.
--
-- Actions:
--  A1 -   Art Brzezinski to update the file as indicated in D1 below.  
--  Response:                          Status: CLOSED
--         File has been updated as indicated in D1 below.
--
--  A2 -   Art Brzezinski to check the latest atommib for possible 
--         overlap between the raw table counters and atommib counters.
--  Response:                          Status: CLOSED
--         Latest available mib (draft-ietf-atommib-atm2-05.txt) does
--         not contain counters that overlap with raw table counters.
-- 
--  A3 -   Art Brzezinski to implement call release counter.
--  Response:                          Status: CLOSED
--         'Normal call clearing' cause code counter has been
--         implemented to provide stats on normal call releases.
--
-- Decisions:
--  D1 -   SVCSigStats.mib shall be updated as follows:
--   a) document the meaning of ifIndex in table entry objects description
--   b) do not implement stats reset functionality
--   c) create and use local textual conventions for each counter
--   d) change duration of the interval units to seconds
--   e) enhance description of transited calls counters
--   f) enhance description of connected calls counters
--   g) enhance description of setup attempts counters to indicate that
--      retransmitted setup attempts are not counted
--   h) enhance description of other causes counters to indicate that
--      normal call clearing and response to status enquiry causes are
--      not counted
--   i) add active call counter to the raw table
--   j) rename the raw table to nncExtSvcSigStatsRawTable
--   k) enhance description of a screening failures counter to indicate
--      that the counter applies to the calling party number
