      otherwise the component inherits the CID of its parent. The top-
      level component has a CID of 0.
      
      Every operator session also has a CID, which is the CID 
      provisioned for the operator's user ID. An operator will see only the 
      stream data for components having a matching CID. Also, the 
      operator will be allowed to issue commands for only those 
      components which have a matching CID.
      
      An operator CID of 0 is used to identify the Network Manager 
      (referred to as 'NetMan' in DPN). This CID matches the CID of 
      any component. Values 1 to 8191 inclusive (equivalent to 'basic

      is not supported or that none of the status conditions described 
      below are present.
      
      The value inTest indicates that the resource is undergoing a test 
      procedure. If adminState is locked or shuttingDown, the normal 
      users are precluded from using the resource and controlStatus is

     "This attribute specifies how ingress voice traffic is encoded.
      
      If voiceEncoding is g711G726, ingress voice traffic is encoded 
      using either pulse code modulation (PCM) defined by ITU-T G.711 
      or adaptive differential pulse code modulation (ADPCM) defined by

      negotiated ingress voice rates in negotiatedIgRates.
      
      If voiceEncoding is g728at16, ingress voice traffic is encoded using

      algorithm defined by ITU-T G.728. If voiceEncoding is g728at16,

      If voiceEncoding is g729at8, ingress voice traffic is encoded using 
      the Conjugated Structure Algebraic Code Excited Linear Predictive 
      Coder (CS-ACELP) algorithm defined by ITU-T G.729. If

      VoiceService is running on a DS1V, E1V, 1pDS1V, 1pE1V or J2MV 
      card. Also, voiceEncoding can only be set to g728at16 or g729at8 if 
      the corresponding feature exists in the featureList of the Sw Lpt.
      
      The negotiated ingress voice encoding is available in

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute specifies how ingress modemFax and fax traffic are 
      encoded.
      
      Voice traffic is all traffic from the start of a call or speech until a 
      2100 Hz tone or call release. ModemFax traffic is all traffic after a 
      2100 Hz tone but before a fax preamble, speech or call release. Fax 
      traffic is all traffic after a fax preamble but before speech or call 
      release.
      
      If modemFaxEncoding is useVoiceEncoding, all ingress traffic is 
      treated like voice traffic and encoded according to voiceEncoding. If 
      voiceEncoding is g728at16 or g729at8, modem and fax calls are not 
      supported.
      
      If modemFaxEncoding is g711G726, ingress modemFax traffic and 
      fax traffic are both encoded using pulse code modulation (PCM) 
      defined by ITU-T G.711 or adaptive differential pulse code 
      modulation (ADPCM) defined by ITU-T G.726. The actual 
      encoding and rates performed depends on congestion in the network 
      and the minimum and maximum ingress modemFax rates in 
      negotiatedIgRates.
      
      If modemFaxEncoding is faxRelayG711G726, ingress modemFax 
      traffic is encoding using G.711 or G.726, exactly as it is if 
      modemFaxEncoding is g711G726. Until a fax preamble is detected, 
      the rate may fluctuate between the minimum and maximum 
      modemFax rates in negotiatedIgRates due to network congestion, 
      exactly as it does if modemFaxEncoding is g711G726. If a fax 
      preamble is detected, all subsequent traffic during a call is 
      demodulated and sent through the network as cells at the base rate 
      of the sending machine. Supported demodulation methods are V.29 
      (up to 9.6 kbit/s) and V.27 (up to 4.8 kbit/s). The modulation and 
      demodulation of fax traffic is called 'fax relay'.
      
      If modemFaxEncoding is faxRelayOnly, 'fax relay' is entered 
      immediately upon 2100 Hz tone detection and modemFax traffic is 
      treated like fax traffic. If modemFaxEncoding is faxRelayOnly, 
      modem calls are not supported.
      
      The negotiated ingress modemFax and fax encodings are available 
      in negotiatedIgEncoding.
      
      modemFaxEncoding cannot be set to faxRelayG711G726 or 
      faxRelayOnly if this voice service is running on a DS1V, E1V, 
      1pDS1V, 1pE1V or J2MV card. The faxRelay feature is required to 
      set modemFaxEncoding to faxRelayG711G726 or faxRelayOnly.
      
      modemFaxEncoding must have the same value at both ends of a 
      VoiceService. If modemFaxEncoding does not have the same value 
      at both ends of a VoiceService, the VoiceService will be out of 
      service. In this case, serviceFailureReason is 
      mismatchedModemFaxEncoding."

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute specifies the amount of added output delay used to 
      compensate for cross network delay variations. It applies to voice, 
      modem and fax traffic. It is required to add output delay so that the 
      statistical variation in the transit time of cells crossing the network 
      does not cause gaps in speech. Backbone networks where high 
      priority traffic consumes a high percentage of trunk bandwidth will 
      require a higher insertedOutputDelay to compensate for the greater 
      cell delay variation (CDV).
      
      insertedOutputDelay must be default if this voice service is running 
      on a DS1V, E1V, 1pDS1V, 1pE1V or J2MV card. On all other 
      cards, insertedOutputDelay can be set to any value. On these cards, 
      default is equivalent to 22."

      attributes. When using Passport component name representation, 
      end points are identified using a node name and a service name. As 
      an example, the end point component for a third voice service on 
      node MoonBase is: 'EM/MoonBase VS/3'. If the remoteName is 
      provisioned, it must match the name of the remote end or the 
      connection will not be established even if the remote end is 
      provisioned correctly. If no remoteName is provisioned, then this 
      LC will accept connections from any other remote LC and it will 
      not originate calls. Connections establish faster and are unique if 
      both ends are provisioned with remoteName. 
      RemoteName should be used when the remote end of the connection 
      resides within the same topology region. If it resides in a different 
      topology region, then addressToCall and localAddress PLC 
      attributes should be used. When both remoteName and 
      addressToCall are provisioned, addressToCall takes precedence. 
      That is, connection will be established to the service specified by

   DESCRIPTION

      automatically or by static provisioning. The default (normal) is to 
      automatically choose a route with Route Selection. Normal 
      pathTypes require less provisioning and can dynamically handle 
      path failures. The other pathTypes are both manual pathTypes where 
      the operator must specify, through provisioning, a static route 
      termed the manualPath. A manual pathType connection is nearly 
      identical to a normal path type connection with the exception that 
      the route is pre-provisioned. For a manual pathType, bandwidth 
      reservations are respected along the path exactly as in a normal 
      path. The last type, the forced pathType, is also a manual path but 
      regardless of the bandwidth available the route is granted provided 
      the trunks are operational and there are sufficient Logical Channels 
      (LChs).
      The forced pathType could result in over committing the reserved 
      bandwidth allowed on a trunk. A better way to achieve the effects of 
      a forced pathType is to use a manual pathType with setupPriority = 
      0 and holdingPriority = 0. In this manner the path will reserve 
      correct bandwidth and it will bump other paths if required while not 
      being bumped itself."

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute is optional and specifies the sequence of trunks to be 
      used as the route for the path, thus bypassing PORS' automatic 
      route selection. If the path fails the validation, no other path can be 
      selected1. This attribute should only be used in special cases since 
      the route selection algorithm is able to find and maintain the best 
      routes. A related path attribute, the pathType, determines if this 
      route will be used as a manual or forced path type. 
      As an example, the trunk component name for the third trunk on 
      node MoonBase is 'EM/MoonBase Trk/3'. Note that only the first 
      end of the trunk that the packet would encounter is provisioned. 
      These strings are case insensitive but the complete component name 
      must be input. 
      
      Note 1: the trunk designation must be a 3-letter form, e.g., 'trk'. 
      Note 2: only the outbound trunks component names are used to 
      provision the manualPath.
      
      Note 3: It is recommended to have two independent routes specified 
      for a manual path by specifying a different manualPath 
      (non-symmetric) for each end. In this case, there is no way to select 
      which route will be used (first up wins) but if one path is torn down 
      due to a failure then the other manualPath may be used to reroute 
      the path."

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute indicates whether the path for this PLC was 
      determined automatically or by static provisioning. Normal 
      pathTypes are selected automatically by Route Selector.The other 
      pathTypes are both manual pathTypes where the operator must 
      specify, through provisioning, a static route termed the manualPath. 
      A manual pathType connection is nearly identical to a normal path 
      type connection with the exception that the route is pre-provisioned. 
      For a manual pathType, bandwidth reservations are respected along 
      the path exactly as in a normal path. The last type, the forced 
      pathType, is also a manual path but regardless of the bandwidth 
      available the route is granted provided the trunks are operational 
      and there are sufficient Logical Channels (LChs).
      
      The forced pathType could result in over committing the reserved 
      bandwidth allowed on a trunk. A better way to achieve the effects of 
      a forced pathType is to use a manual pathType with setupPriority = 
      0 and holdingPriority = 0. In this manner the path will reserve 
      correct bandwidth and it will bump other paths if required while not 
      being bumped itself."

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute reflects the last tear down reason for a connection 
      (LCo). In many cases this displays the reason for a momentary 
      service interruption. This attribute applies to the last path failure 
      only. If a path is no longer up, this may give an indication to the 
      reason that the path has failed. In many cases an alarm will also be 
      generated with more specific information. The following is a brief 
      description of the reasons:
      none - This path has no information for the teardown this is typical 
      of a path provisioned with no remoteName that has not been up.
      normalShutDown - This path has gone down due to normal call 
      termination.
      insufficientTxLcOrBandwidth - At present there is either no 
      available bandwidth or logical channel numbers available on one or 
      more of the trunks for this path in the transmit direction.
      insufficientRxLcOrBandwidth - At present there is either no 
      available bandwidth or logical channel numbers available on one or 
      more of the trunks for this path in the receive direction.
      trunkFailure- A trunk on the path has failed or has gone down due 
      to a provisioning change of a critical attribute.
      trunkCardFailure- A trunk FP card has failed along the path.
      accessCardFailure- The FP on which the peer access service was 
      running has failed.
      operatorForced- The path has terminated due to the operator 
      locking a trunk along the path.
      lostLcnClash- The path has terminated because the PA's at both 
      ends of an intermediate trunk have allocated the same LC to 
      different calls. When this happens both calls must go down and then 
      try to come up again a fraction of a second later (effectively 
      ensuring that they will now be assigned different LC's). It is normal 
      to get the odd clash especially when the PA's usedLC is 
      approaching the PA's maxLC.
      networkCongestion - The path has failed due to control information 
      being lost and not recoverable.
      trunkNotFound - Occurs on a manual path usually. Check for 
      trunks not up or names provisioned incorrectly.
      farEndNotFound - The far end is not provisioned or is not up. 
      Check remote Name.
      wrongModuleReached - This may occur on a manual path. Check 
      provisioning for correct trunk and service names. For a normal 
      path, the network Topology may be changing check remoteName.
      farEndBusy - The far end has been reached but it is busy. Check 
      remoteName and remote end provisioning.
      callLoopedBack - This LCo is provisioned to call itself. Re-
      provision since this is invalid.
      unknownReason - The failure was not resolved.
      farEndNotReady - The remote end was reached but the connection 
      was refused due to the remote end not being enabled.
      remoteNameMismatch - The remote end has alarmed and rejected 
      this setup due to remoteName provisioning.
      serviceTypeMismatch - The remote Service Type does not match 
      this service type. Check provisioning.
      reconnectFromFarEnd - The remote end re-established this 
      connection. Check the remote end lastTearDownReason to 
      determine the real reason.
      bumped - Another call bumped this path from a trunk to get 
      bandwidth (or an LC) which it required to come up. This other path 
      had a higher setupPriority than this path's holdingPriority hence it 
      was allowed to steal the bandwidth (or LC) from this path.
      optimized - This call has been rerouted due to the optimization 
      feature. The call is still active this just indicates why the path 
      changed.
      trunkOrFarEndDidNotSupportMode - This call was unable to 
      complete because a mode required by the service was not supported 
      by one of the trunks the route went through or by the far end service 
      it connected to. Currently the only mode that this applies to is the 
      map/mux mode on TRUNK PA ATM component. Map mode was 
      required by the application (CES/FrAtm etc.) but was not available 
      on the TRUNK PA ATM component through which the call was 
      routed or the far end CES/FrAtm component did not specify the 
      same mode."

      displays reRoutePath, the path may attempt an immediate reroute, 
      provided the failure is a recoverable failure. If rerouting fails the 
      application is informed of the failure. 
      With this option set to reRoutePath the LCo may wait up to 30 
      seconds before informing the service of complete disconnection in 
      order to allow both ends to attempt to reconnect. Note that if PLC 
      components are different at both ends only the calling end is
