          DESCRIPTION "
       The following two variables are provided as a way of reporting SNMP 
       errors to the management station. The SNMP agent keeps track two
       variables for each set request (last oid and last error message that
       was caused by setting the value for last oid).  This information is
       based on the incoming ipaddress and port, so there is only one instance
       available for each source.  The management station will only see errors
       that is the result of its own set request.  If there is no errors
       available for this source, no value is returned."
