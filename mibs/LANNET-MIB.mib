      DESCRIPTION
      "A 48-bit unique identifier of the hub. Not to be confused with the
       48-bit address of the MAC that may be used to obtain management
       access to the hub when in-band signaling is used.
       If a manufacturer builds a hub with an on-board MAP for communicating
       network management information, the manufacturer has the option
       to use the same address for both HubID and MAC address. This option
       is implemented by LANNET agents for LET-18 and LET- 36."

       attribute to zero is interpreted by LANNET agents as a RESET commnand.
