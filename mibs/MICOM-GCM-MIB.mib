                    except the backup link is not used.\
                    When the primary link is active, the \
                    GCM will not deactivate the backup \
                    port.  If the backup port is an \
                    ISDN card, the GCM can be configured \
                    to allow incoming calls by using the \
                    link specified by the object \
                    <gcmUnitRegionalLinkIndex>. When the
                    primary link fails, the activated \
                    link <gcmUnitRegionalLinkIndex> \
                    (eg. configured for incoming connection \
                    ISDN) will be disconnected and the \
                    backup link will be activated. \
                    Note that there is no deactivation \
                    of the backup port and ISDN incomming \
                    calls can be accepted when the backup \
                    is not used for backing up the primary \
                    connection.\

                    need to have the backup functionality. \
                    The GCM will enable both ports. \
                    In the case of ISDN, it is possible \
                    to accept incomming calls. Primary link \
                    and backup link will have the same \
                    priority, there is no correlation \
                    between them. The GCM will activate \
                    all GCM links configured for this unit.

--  the GCM Link Table 
--  (Configuration Parameters)

--  All GCM Links are defined and configured in the GCM Link Table. 
--  Each GCM Link consists of a signaling link and a protocol link.  In the case 
--  of an ISDN dial up connection, the signaling link will be represented by an
--  entry in the Dial Control MIB, which uses the ISDN signaling channel 
--  (D Channel).  The protocol link can be configured to Frame Relay. 
--  The protocol PPP is not configurable for the Protocol link, because 
--  the access device does not include this protocol. It is only for future purposes.
--  
--  Each ISDN link is configured in the Dial Control MIB, including the 
--  remote ISDN address for a dial up line or the B Channel access parameter 
--  for a leased line.  Currently, the protocol link can only set to Frame Relay.
--  
--  For a serial WAN card, the signaling link has to be configured to the value 
--  unused (2) and the protocol link to Frame Relay.
--  
--  If the GCM activates an ISDN GCM Link, it first activates the associated 
--  hardware port and then the configured ISDN link.  After the ISDN connection
--  is established, the GCM sends an activation request to the Frame Relay to 
--  establish the Frame Relay over the B Channel.

--  the GCM Backup Configuration Table 
--  (Configuration Parameters)

--  The GCM Links for the backup medium will be stored in the GCM Backup 
--  Configuration Table.  During configuration of the access device via an NMS or CLI, 
--  the administrator can decide which of the two ports will be the backup or the 
--  primary port.  The GCM is flexible to handle this kind of configuration.
--  
--  Also, the GCM allows configuration of multiple (up to 255) backup link rows
--  for a single GCM Unit.  If the primary link fails, the GCM tries to re-establish 
--  the connection over the backup medium by trying all backup links successively.
--  
--  An erroneous configuration (e.g., unknown Signaling links in the ISDN Dial 
--  Control MIB) will only be detected during the loading of the GCM configuration 
--  file, and intercommunication between the GCM and the Circuit Managers.

--  Each hardware interface controlled by the GCM is defined in the GCM Hardware

--  Each hardware interface is represented by an entry in this table.  The table is a fixed,
--  read-only table with six rows.  Each entry represents the status of a hardware interface.
