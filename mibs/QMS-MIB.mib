	DESCRIPTION
		"Also known as System Use, this non-configurable client is the amount
		of RAM used to run the printer's operating system. It's never

	DESCRIPTION
		"Also known as Host Input and K Mem for Spool, this memory client 
		stores incoming data from all the interfaces until the emulation can 
		process the print job. When enough memory is allocated to this client, 
		the host becomes free more quickly, and the number of jobs that the 
		printer can accept simultaneously is increased. You should consider 
		the amount of data being sent simultaneously when allocating mem-
		ory to the spool buffer. If available, a hard disk can supplement this 
		client with additional memory needed for spooling. Size is returned in
		Kilobytes.  

		Note: While increasing this client is beneficial in reducing network 
		      traffic, throughput is not necessarily increased. In addition, making 
		      this client too large could actually decrease throughput because of 
		      the overhead involved with managing a large spool."
	::= { qmsMemory 4 }

qmsClientEmulation OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX INTEGER
	ACCESS read-only
	STATUS mandatory
	DESCRIPTION
		"Also known as K Mem Emulation, this client is used to store any 
		optional or loadable emulations, such as LN03 Plus or QUIC II. 
		Increasing this client's memory allows you to load more than one 
		optional emulation so that it doesn't have to be reloaded every time 
		the print job is sent.

		If an emulation is loaded to process a print job and there is not 
		enough memory in the emulation client, another emulation already 
		loaded may be unloaded automatically to obtain enough memory. If 
		you notice a delay in printing between jobs that have different nonres-
		ident emulations, it's possible that the emulations are having to reload 
		each time they're run. Adding to the emulation client may eliminate 
		the unloading and reloading of these emulations and, consequently, 
		increase throughput. It is recommended that you should add at least 
		1 MB of physical RAM to your printer and increase this memory client 
		by 1 MB for each additional emulation loaded. If your printer has an 
		optional hard disk and the disk swapping option is turned on then you 
		can increase the emulation memory client using this memory. 
		
		Size is returned in Kilobytes.

		Note: You should add at least 1 MB to the emulation memory client for 
		      each loadable emulation that your printer uses. Failure to add 
		      memory to this client may prevent the printer from loading and using 
		      the emulation. You should check the documentation accompanying 
		      your loadable emulation for information on additional resource 
		      requirements.

		Also increase the emulation client if you're printing complex non-Post-
		Script jobs that may require more memory to process correctly."

qmsClientHeap OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX INTEGER
	ACCESS read-only
	STATUS mandatory
	DESCRIPTION
		"Also known as K Mem PSHeap, Heap, PostScript VM, and Virtual 
		Memory, this client holds downloaded fonts, PostScript operators, and 
		forms.

		Inefficiently coded PostScript jobs can consume an extremely large 
		amount of virtual memory or leave objects in the PostScript Heap 
		after the print jobs are completed, leading to virtual memory errors. If 
		not enough memory is allocated to the PS Heap, the job cannot print. 

		Increasing the memory allocated to this client allows more complex 
		jobs to print and increases the number of fonts that can be down-
		loaded to virtual memory. 

		However, this client should be increased only if you receive a virtual 
		memory error when attempting to print a job or download a font, and 
		even then it should be increased only in small increments until the 
		error message goes away. Excess memory in the PS Heap is not 
		used."
	::= { qmsMemory 6 }

qmsClientFontCache OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX INTEGER
	ACCESS read-only
	STATUS mandatory
	DESCRIPTION
		"Also known as K Mem PS Fonts and Font Cache, this memory client 
		stores bitmapped representations of previously scaled PostScript 
		fonts. This process reduces the number of times a font must be con-
		verted from outline form to bitmap form. Printing pages that have 
		characters already stored in the font cache is immensely faster than 
		printing characters not yet in the font cache.

		As the font cache memory fills, the printer makes room for new bit-
		mapped characters by erasing those that have been in the cache 
		longest without being used. Increasing the memory allocated to this 
		client, allows the printer to store more characters and spend less time 
		erasing and replacing characters in the cache. You should be careful 
		when increasing this client because the printer may spend more time 
		searching the cache than it would scaling the character. This client 
		has a limit to the maximum point size it will store.

		Normally, you don't need to change this memory client unless you 
		use a large number of fonts at various point sizes. If you do, you may 
		allocate additional memory to this client to improve printer perfor-
		mance. There's no specific formula to use in figuring the amount of 
		memory required by the font cache, but after a certain point, large font 
		caches cause the printer to take longer to print than smaller font 
		caches because of the search time through the cache. The recom-
		mended font cache size is in the following ranges:

			* 128-256 KB for 300x300 dpi printing
			* 256-512 KB for 600x600 dpi printing
			* 384-512 KB for 1200x1200 dpi printing

		You should experiment to see what font cache size works best for 
		you.

		Size is returned in Kilobytes."
	::= { qmsMemory 7 }

qmsClientDisplayList OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX INTEGER
	ACCESS read-only
	STATUS mandatory
	DESCRIPTION
		"Also known as K Mem Display, this client stores compressed repre-
		sentations, or blocks, of the pages to be printed. It takes approxi-
		mately one compressed block for a normal 8.5'' x 11'' (215.9 mm x 
		279.4 mm) text page, four compressed blocks for an 8.5'' x 11''
		(215.9mm x 279.4 mm) page that includes some graphics, and as 
		many as 500 compressed blocks for an extremely complex page.

		Many pages of compressed blocks belonging to multiple print jobs 
		can be stored at the same time in the display list. If enough memory is 
		allocated to this memory client, a page can always be ready to print 
		as soon as another page has been imaged to the print engine.

        The amount of memory required for each compressed block is printer
        specific. See your printer specific manual for the amount of memory
        that a disply list will require for each compressed block. If a page 
		includes raster image data (for example, TIFF or bitmap data),
        each compressed block will require much more memory.

        Increasing the amount of memory in this client may improve printing
        throughput and minimize slowdowns due to collating or printing com-
        plex pages. If your Print System has a hard disk and the disk swap
        option is enabled, the memory added to this client is taken from virtual
        memory. If your printer does not have a hard disk then, the memory added
        to this client is taken from the amount of physical memory in your printer.
        It may be necessary to reduce memory added to another client before adding
        memory to the Display List. Check that the Frame Buffer still has the minimum
        amount of memory needed for your printing needs before reallocating this memory.
		
		Size is returned in Kilobytes."
	::= { qmsMemory 8 }

qmsClientFrameBuffer OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX INTEGER
	ACCESS read-only
	STATUS mandatory
	DESCRIPTION
		"The Frame Buffer memory client holds rasterized or bitmapped 
		images of page faces which are ready to be sent to the print engine. A 
		frame holds the contents of each single page image. For example, a 
		600 dpi page printed on letter size paper would consume frame buffer 
		memory space as follows:
		  (600dpi x 600dpi x 8.5 in x 11 in) /8 = 4,207,500 bytes or 4.1 MB.

		Because the frame buffer memory is so critical to the actual printing 
		of a page, its allocation takes precedence over that of other memory 
		clients. The number of frames needed to print at engine speed is 
		engine specific and depends on the size media and resolution. For 
		example, printing at 600x600 dpi requires four times the amount of 
		memory in the frame buffer than does 300x300 dpi.

		If you are uncertain about how to configure your printer's memory, 
		use only the Administration/Memory/QuickConfig menu. This menu 
		appears if your printer does not have a hard disk attached or if the 
		disk swap option is disabled. Use this menu as a starting point before 
		trying manually to configure your printer's memory.

		It provides a simple method of defining how much memory should go 
		to each of the clients for the most complicated printing conditions in 
		your environment. Menu options allow you to specify the largest 
		media size at the resolution you plan to use. Memory is then automat-
		ically allocated to the clients.

		Size is returned in Kilobytes.

qmsClientEmulTemp OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX  INTEGER
	ACCESS read-only
	STATUS mandatory
	DESCRIPTION
		"Also known as K Mem Emul Tmp and Emulation Temporary, this cli-
		ent sets the amount of system memory to be used by non-PostScript 
		emulations for storing downloaded many different non-Post Script 
		fonts, forms, or macros. By dedicating a portion of memory to this cli-
		ent, your printer can perform context switching, which is the ability to 
		retain downloaded fonts and forms even after the printer changes 
		from one emulation to another. Context switching prevents unneces-
		sary repetitive downloading and traffic congestion on networks. 

		Normally, this memory client doesn't need to be changed unless you 
		plan to download many different non-PostScript fonts, forms, or mac-
		ros.

		Size is returned in Kilobytes."
	::= { qmsMemory 10 }

qmsClientDisk OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX INTEGER
	ACCESS read-only
	STATUS mandatory
	DESCRIPTION
		"This memory client stores frequently used data in system memory 
		instead of continually storing and retrieving it from a hard disk. If a 
		hard disk is used and a lot of disk access is required, adding memory 
		to the disk cache may increase the printer's performance.

		For example, if many fonts are stored on disk, faster access to these 
		fonts is achieved by increasing the disk cache size. Conversely, if no 
		hard disk is used, the disk cache will automatically be set to 0 KB until 
		a hard disk is installed and formatted. However, when one or more 
		hard disks are installed and formatted, disk cache is automatically 
		allocated 256 KB.

		The disk cache is a high-speed temporary buffer for data going to and 
		from the hard disk. It can speed up the printer in two ways:

		* Information such as frequently referenced fonts and logos may 
		  still be in the cache and may not have to be pulled off a hard disk 
		  each time they're needed.

		* Information being written to a hard disk can be held in the cache 
		  temporarily until a more convenient time to be written to disk.

		The amount of memory needed for the disk cache client is dependent 
		on the size of the disk, the number of disks, the number of subdirecto-
		ries on each disk, and the amount of memory dedicated to caching. 
		As long as the disk cache is enabled and there is enough memory in 
		the disk cache, all disks are accessible. If insufficient memory is allo-
		cated to the disk cache, some disks may be seen while others are 
		not.

		The recommended amount of memory for the disk cache client for all 
		hard disk is as follows:

		* 45 KB internal usage

		* 0.5 KB per MB of disk storage total for all disks

		* 100 KB of memory dedicated to caching

		For example, the recommended amount of memory for the disk cache 
		for a single 120 MB hard disk would be 208 KB, and for two 120 MB 
		hard disks it would be 268 KB.

		Size is returned in Kilobytes."

qmsClientColorMatching OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX INTEGER
	ACCESS read-only
	STATUS mandatory
	DESCRIPTION
		"The Color Matching memory client provides storage space for the
                control and operation of the Color Matching feature.  The available
                space is used to process the generation and management of printer 
                resident, custom ICC color matching profiles, as-well-as the 
                feature generated device link conversion maps.  These device link
                maps are ultimately used for RGB and CMYK device space color 
                conversion.

                By retaining the most frequently used profile and device link 
                information in primary storage, performance of the color matching
                operation is increased.  This increase comes from the ellimination of
                the time required to find and load the desired ICC profiles for a given 
                job, and to then generate the device link map used during color
                conversion by the printer's page description language.

                The size of ICC profiles used for color matching device link generation
                will affect the amount of free space remaining to the memory client
                for routine color matching operations.  The feature will routinely 
                unload unused profiles and device links as necessary to retain
                sufficient free space for operation.  However, if downloaded custom ICC
                profiles are overly large, excessive memory can be consumed for 
                device link generation, exhausting available client memory needed for
                other operations.  This will result in color matching processing errors
                being reported to the user.

                If color matching memory resource errors occur, the problem can be
                corrected by reducing the quality setting of the generated device link 
                maps via the operator panel, or by increasing the amount of memory
                available to the color matching client.

		If you are uncertain about how to configure your printer's memory, 
		use only the Administration/Memory/QuickConfig menu. This menu

		Inefficiently coded PCL and XL jobs can consume an extremely large 
		amount of virtual memory or leave objects in the HP Heap after the 
                print jobs are completed, leading to virtual memory errors. If 
		not enough memory is allocated to the HP Heap, the job cannot print. 

		Increasing the memory allocated to this client allows more complex 
		jobs to print and increases the number of fonts that can be down-
		loaded to virtual memory. 

		However, this client should be increased only if you receive a virtual 
		memory error when attempting to print a job or download a font, and 
		even then it should be increased only in small increments until the 
		error message goes away. Excess memory in the HP Heap is not used.

		Size is returned in Kilobytes."

	DESCRIPTION
		"The Print Quality option allows the printer to operate at a lower 
		rate of toner consumption and extend the life of your toner cartridges. 
		This option also allows you to enable other installed quality features.

		Choices
			Normal: Normal toner use.
			Conserve Toner: Toner use is lowered.
			Smooth(600dpi): Requires MultiRes board.
                        Fine Mode: Reduces chassis vibration during image processing.

		Default
			Normal

		Notes
			When Conserve Toner is selected the Toner Density 
			option can be adjusted for the best acceptable print 
			quality. Toner Density can be set from 1 to 15.

			Smoothing alters the size and position of dots that lie 
			on the outer edges of an object by reducing the width of 
			the laser pulse to a fraction of the full pulse width. This 
			smooths jagged-edges in text, lines, and graphics and 
			generally improves their print quality.

                        Fine Mode reduces the media feed rate, allowing each sheet
                        to complete the image transfer process before the next sheet
                        is fed to the media path.  This reduces chassis vibration 
                        that occurs during paper movement to a minimum level during
                        image processing.

		Note: When printing halftones, smoothing is not recommended 
		      because it may introduce artifacts in the halftone or 
		      scanned image.  For better results if smoothing is 
		      required for your documents in text and line art, use 
		      the basic option for halftone types."
