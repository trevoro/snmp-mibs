   DESCRIPTION
     "If supported by the component, this attribute indicates the OSI 
      Availability status of the component. Note that, even though it is 
      defined as a multi-valued set, at most one value is shown to the user.
      
      When no values are in the set, this indicates that either the attribute 
      is not supported or that none of the status conditions described 
      below is present.
      
      The value inTest indicates that the resource is undergoing a test 
      procedure. If adminState is locked or shuttingDown, the normal 
      users are precluded from using the resource and controlStatus is 
      reservedForTest. Tests that do not exclude additional users can be 
      present in any operational or administrative state but the 
      reservedForTest condition should not be present.
      
      The value failed indicates that the component has an internal fault 
      that prevents it from operating. The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value dependency indicates that the component cannot operate 
      because some other resource on which it depends is unavailable. 
      The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value powerOff indicates the resource requires power to be 
      applied and it is not powered on. The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value offLine indicates the resource requires a routine 
      operation (either manual, automatic, or both) to be performed to 
      place it on-line and make it available for use. The operationalState 
      is disabled.
      
      The value offDuty indicates the resource is inactive in accordance 
      with a predetermined time schedule. In the absence of other 
      disabling conditions, the operationalState is enabled or disabled.
      
      The value degraded indicates the service provided by the 
      component is degraded in some way, such as in speed or operating 
      capacity. Usually, the resource remains available for service. The 
      operationalState is almost always enabled. There is one exception 
      where an operationalState of disabled is used in conjunction with 
      degraded for a component which represents a rolled up view of a 
      set of other components.
      
      The value notInstalled indicates the resource is not present. The 
      operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value logFull is not used.
      
      The value migrating indicates that a software migration activation 
      is in progress, making the component unavailable for other 
      activities until the migration is complete.

      is not supported or that none of the status conditions described

      The value initializationRequired indicates (for a resource which 
      doesn't initialize autonomously) that initialization is required before 
      it can perform its normal functions, and this procedure has not been 
      initiated. The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value notInitialized indicates (for a resource which does

      initiated. The operationalState may be enabled or disabled.
      
      The value initializing indicates that initialization has been initiated 
      but is not yet complete. The operationalState may be enabled or

      processing operation and is notifying the results. The

      The value terminating indicates the component is in a termination

      The value subjectToTest indicates the resource is available but tests 
      may be conducted simultaneously at unpredictable times, which 
      may cause it to exhibit unusual characteristics.
      
      The value partOfServicesLocked indicates that part of the service is

      The value reservedForTest indicates that the component is

     "This attribute provides the threshold value which defines when a 
      minor alarm would be issued, denoting a sustained total average 
      link utilization. The total average link utilization is calculated based 
      on the number of received bytes. The Set alarm is issued after 3 
      minutes of utilization greater than the given threshold. The 
      corresponding Clear alarm is issued after a subsequent 3 minutes of 
      utilization less than or equal to the given threshold.
      The value 100% is used to disable an individual threshold. For 
      values other than 100%, a semantic check ensures that the minor 
      alarm threshold is less than the other thresholds."
