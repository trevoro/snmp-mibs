          DESCRIPTION
              "This object controls a number of parameters associated
              with IP security.  Each parameter is represented by
              a specific bit.  If the bit is set, the parameter is
              turned on.  If the bit is not set, the parameter is
              turned off.  The state of all the parameters is represented
              by a sum of all the bits, the value of each bit being
              multiplied by 2 raised to the power of the position
              of the bit in the integer.

              With bit 0 being the least significant bit, the table
              below defines the mapping of security parameters to bits.

                 bit #               Parameter

                  3                  LabelStrip

              If bit 0 is set, the Extended parameter is turned on.  
              This allows datagrams with extended security options to be
              received and/or transmitted from this port.

              If bit 1 is set, the BasicFirst parameter is turned on.  This
              indicates that the basic security option is always transmitted
              as the first option in the datagram, even if the packet
              has to be rearranged.  If this bit is not set, the datagram
              options are sent as is.
                        
              If bit 2 is set, the LabelAdd parameter is turned on.  This
              ensures that all datagrams leaving this port have a label
              attached to them.  If an outgoing datagram does not have
              a label, the default label, computed for the datagram
              on receipt, is attached to it before transmission.  If this
              parameter is turned off, then datagrams without labels are
              allowed to be transmitted, and the default label is not 
              attached to the datagram.

              If bit 3 is set, the LabelStrip parameter is turned on.  In 
              this case, any basic security option present in the datagram
              is stripped before transmission through this port.  The
              stripping is done after all the security processing has been 
              done.  If this parameter is turned off, the label is transmitted
              as is."
