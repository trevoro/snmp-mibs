                         //<ip-address>[:port][<pathname>[<filename>]]
                 This includes the IP address host to contact, and optionally
		 the port on that host, the directory on that host to put the 
		 data into and the filename.  
		 The pathname and filename are each strings of characters 
		 with the following special tokens:
 
                 Token       Description
                 _____ _______________________________________________________
                  %T   SwitchType   - identifies the type of switch.
                                        eg  `vss' for Vector
                  %N   SwitchNumber - `SerialNumber.SwitchIndex' for a
				       non-enclosure switch(fabric) or 
				       `EnclosureNumber.SwitchIndex' of a
                                       multi-fabric switch within an enclosure.
				       The SwitchIndex is the slot number of the
				       fabric within the enclosure(starting at 0).
				       In the case of a non-enclosure switch,
				       the SwitchIndex is always 0.
                  %I   SwitchIP     - switch's IP address eg `169.144.1.90'
                  %D   DateTime     - formatted as `YYMMDDhhmm'.
                  %R   RecordingInterval - elapsed time in minutes.
                  %C   CRType       - identifies the contents of the file.
                                        - `account' for callrecord data
                                        - `stats' for Performance data
                  %F   FileStatus   - status of the file.
                                        - `co' for file that switch(fabric) is 
                                               currently writing to
                                        - `cc' for file that switch(fabric) has
                                               completed writing to
		
		 If the pathname is not specified, the default file is
		 transferred to the login directory specified by crXfrUserid.  
                 The following string will be used as the default filename in 
                 the case where the URL ends with a `/'(i.e. without any 
                 filename):
                         %T_%C.%D.%R.%N.%F
                 If multiple switches are to write to the same location, 
                 the pathname or filename should contain either a %I or a 
                 %N token.  A %D token in the filename portion will
                 separate each RecordingInterval worth of data into a different
                 file with the name being the time the file was created.
                 The following example would record every switch type and 
                 switch IP into a separate directory with a file at each 
                 RecordingInterval:
                         //169.144.1.5/usr/auditlog/%T/%I/%D
                 Given a Work Group switch with an IP address of 169.44.4.4,
		 this would produce files in the following directory tree 
		 structure:
                        /usr/auditlog/ASX200WG/169.44.4.4/9608252355
		 If the filename specified is not made up of the above tokens,
		 then it is used as a prefix to the default filename.

                 If the file transfer attempt fails, the switch will generate a
                 trap and attempt a transfer to crXfrSecondaryUrl.
		 If crAdminStatus is `on' and this value is changed,
		 the change goes into effect at the next aligned 
		 crXfrRecordingInterval."
