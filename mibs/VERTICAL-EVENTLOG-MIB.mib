     --  This is the MIB module for Vertical Networks IO Box
     --  Event Log Traps. This module defines the Traps that

	 --  This MIB is found in the private.enterprise branch

		DESCRIPTION
            "This object describes the Event Type of the last 
			 Event Log trap reported. The following are valid
			 values: 
			 error			(1) -> Error events indicate 
								   significant problems that 
								   the user should know about.
								   Error events usually 
								   indicate a loss of 
								   functionality or data. For
								   example, if a service 
								   cannot be loaded as the 
								   system boots, it can log 
								   an error event.
			 warning		(2) -> Warning events indicate 
								   problems that are not 
								   immediately significant, 
								   but that may indicate 
								   conditions that could 
								   cause future problems. 
								   For example,an application
								   can logs warning event if
								   disk space is low. 
			 information	(3) -> Information events indicate
								   infrequent but significant
								   successful operations. 
			 audit-success	(4) -> Success audit events are
								   security events that occur
								   when an audited access 
								   attempt is successful. For
								   example, a successful logon
								   attempt is a success audit
								   event.
			 audit-fail		(5) -> Failure audit events are 
								   security events that occur
								   when an audited access 
								   attempt fails. For example,
								   a failed attempt to open a
								   file is a failure audit 
								   event.
			unknown			(6)	-> Indicates an event type 
								   other than those described 
								   above."
