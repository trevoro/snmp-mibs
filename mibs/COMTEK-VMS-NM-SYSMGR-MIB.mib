-- Disk Information
--
-- The disk table is a potentially sparce table of disk related information.
-- Each time disk information is collected, new rows are added to the bottom
-- of the disk table for new disks that are discovered.  For disks that 
-- are no longer available, the corresponding row in the disk table becomes
-- inaccessible.  This allows the disk table to be walked to retrieve only
-- the current disk information while ensuring that a disk index (and 
-- therefore the row in the disk table) relates to a specific disk.
-- When the NM*SysMgr Subagent is reinitialized (see sCfgReinitSubagent),
-- any inaccessible rows in the disk table are removed and the disk 
-- indexes and rows are re-numbered to be contiguous.
--
-- Two configuration file flags are available to fine tune which disks are
-- monitored: sCfgLocalDisksOnly and sCfgCritDisksOnly.  These flags can
-- be used alone or in combination to control which disks appear in the
-- disk table (sDskTbl). Disk related traps can only be sent for disks
-- that are in the disk table.
-- 
-- Note:  When disks are shadowed, disk information is reported only
-- for the shadow set virtual unit.

-- Trap Information
-- The NM*SysMgr Subagent process maintains an internal trap table

-- The number of traps that are retained in the internal trap table
-- is controlled by the sCfgTrapTblSize variable.  Each trap that is
-- sent by NM*SysMgr includes a trap sequence number and a timestamp
-- as well as any trap specific data.  The trap sequence number may
-- be used to request that a trap be resent to the manager.  
--
-- The number of traps per second that may be sent is governed by the
-- sCfgMaxTrapSec variable.  sTrapLastSeqNumSent identifies the
-- sequence number of the last trap that was actually sent, if no
-- backlog of traps exists, this number will be one less than
-- sTrapNextSeqNum.  If a backlog exists due to throttling, then
-- the size of the backlog may be determined by comparing these
-- numbers.  If the size of the backlog exceeds the size of the
-- trap table (as set by sCfgTrapTblSize), the backlogged traps
-- will be lost as they are overwritten by new traps, the number
-- of traps that have been lost is contained in sTrapLostCount.

-- Hardware error information for disks, tapes, buses, CPU, and memory
--
-- The hardware error table is a potentially sparce table of device errors.
-- Each time hardware error information is collected, new rows are added 
-- to the bottom of the hardware error table for devices that had not 
-- previously reported errors. For devices that are no longer available, 
-- the corresponding row in the hardware error table becomes inaccessible.  
-- This allows the hardware error table to be walked to retrieve only the 
-- current error information while ensuring that a hardware error table 
-- index (and therefore the row in the hardware error table) relates to a 
-- specific device.  When the NM*SysMgr Subagent is reinitialized

-- table are removed and the hardware error table indexes and rows are
