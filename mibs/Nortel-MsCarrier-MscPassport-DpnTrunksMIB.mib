-- DpnGateway/n
-- The DpnGateway component provides a Passport to DPN-100 
-- connection. It controls a protocol stack associated with a logical 
-- port on a Functional Processor providing a connection to a DPN-
-- 100 Utp Trunk or NetworkLink. The underlying link protocol may 
-- be provided by either Utp or FrAccess. A maximum of 256 
-- instances of DpnGateway may be provisioned on a module.

      For a Trunk with an AtmAccess subcomponent, the value is

      AtmAccess has a value of no, the peak cell rate (PCR) of the VCC,

      the best measurement of the actual cell rate (ACR) of the VCC is 
      used, which is the minimum of the PCR, the CCR and the actual 
      shaping rate (ASR).
