          DESCRIPTION  "
      This mib is used to configure channelized operating modes
      for interfaces that can operate in either channelized
      or concatenated mode.  For now, this is used to support
      the configuration of the Channelized OC12 netmod.  In
      that netmod, each port can operate as an STS12c atm
      cell source, or it can be configured to operate as
      4 STS3c streams channelized over an STS12 sonet path,
      or it can operate as 12xDS3 streams carried in STS3
      paths, which in turn, are multiplexed into an STS12
      path.

      This mib exports a single table which contains an
      row for each channelizable port in the switch.
      Each row has 1 modifiable column to set the operating
      mode of the port.  Note that changing a port's operating
      mode may make dramatic modifications to this and other
      tables as switching the mode of an interface may create or
      destory other interfaces."
