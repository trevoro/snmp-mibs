"Determines the amount of system resources which are required by the X.25 
layer to avoid congestion. When system resources drop below this

- initiates flow control on all existing virtual circuits receiving data 
(an RNR is transmitted on each circuit)

When global resources rise above this threshold after having dropped below 
it, the X.25 layer does the following:

- it disables flow control on all suspended virtual circuits (transmits a 
RR on each circuit that that it previously transmitted an RNR on)

- permits new virtual circuits to be established

--  Logical Links Table

--  A logical link is a grouping of one or more lower service access 
--  points(SAPs), for the purpose of route balancing.  Each lower service 
--  access point is identified by a 2 instance SAP identification.  The 
--  first instance of the SAP id is the SAP number,  which corresponds
--  to the LAPB or LAPD physical (or logical) link maintained through the 
--  sub-layer (normally the Data Link layer).  The second instance is the 
--  Connection Endpoint Suffix (CES), and is only relevant for X.25 over 
--  an ISDN D-Channel.

--  X.25 LAPB service supports only one data link connection and thus only 
--  one SAP is required.  Its CES is irrelevant and is normally set to 0 
--  at this SAP.  This SAP will communicate with its "companion" SAP at 
--  the sub-layer, thus a one-to-one relationship.

--  X.25 LAPD service supports multiple data link connections, and thus 
--  multiple SAPs are required.  The CES for each must be unique and is 
--  normally in the range of 0 to 63.  Each of these SAPs (which are grouped 
--  according to the SAP id specified) will communicate with the same 
--  "companion" SAP at the sub-layer, thus a many-to-one relationship.

--  Two types of routing algorithms are supported, prioritized or balanced.

--  Logical links can be used by route table entries.

Service Access Points

Two types of SAPs exist:

serves an embedded application.

- Lower: A SAP that exists at the lower interface of the X.25 layer and 
serves a single data link connection (LAPB) or multiple data link 
connections (LAPD).

This data link connection, when attached to the sub-layer, can complete a 
LAPB service, or can be one of many supported data link connections over a 
LAPD service.

SAPs are identified by a SAP Number and CES (connection endpoint suffix).

X.25 LAPB service supports only one data link connection and thus only one 
SAP is required. Its CES is irrelevant and is normally set to 0 at this 
SAP. This SAP communicates with its 'companion' SAP at the sub-layer in a

      DESCRIPTION
"Identifies the CES (connection endpoint suffix) that is associated with 
this SAP (service access point). CES is used by X.25 over the ISDN D 
channel to support multiple data links on one physical (LAPD) link. The 
CES for each link must be unique and is normally set in the range 0 to 63.

When associated with a LAPD service at the Data Link layer, the CES is 
combined with the data link SAPI (sap identification index) to form the 
connection endpoint identifier (CEI). This uniquely identifies each data 
link connection. The Data Link layer maps the CES to a TEI (terminal 
endpoint identifier), and combines it with the SAPI to form the DLCI (data 
link connection identifier), which is used on the ISDN D-Channel.

In the case of X.25 LAPB, CES is not used and is set to 0.

When this object is not specified (upper SAPs), its value defaults to 0.

--  Closed User Group Table

--  belonging to the group to communicate with each other, but precludes 
--  communication with all others which are not.  When a SAP belongs to more 
--  than one closed user group, a preferential closed user group must be 
--  specified.

--  Each CUG entry consists of an interlock code and the facilties for 
--  incoming/outgoing calls barred within a CUG.

--  Objects in this table make references to the appropriate sections in the 
--  ITU(CCITT) X.25 (1988) "blue" book.  The reference is identified in the

   DESCRIPTION
"This tables contains CUG (closed user group) definitions for the X.25 
layer. Any service access point (upper or lower) can be part of one or 
more CUGs. 

Each row in the table identifies the CUG parameters for a single member of 
the specified CUG.

CUGs provide the means to regulate incoming and outgoing calls at 
particular SAP. Generally, members of a CUG are defined to only support 
making and receiving calls from other members of the group. However, other 
options are available.

When a SAP belongs to more than one closed user group, a preferential 
closed user group must be specified.

Each CUG entry consists of an interlock code and the facilities for 
incoming/outgoing calls barred within the CUG.

Objects in this table make references to the appropriate sections in the 
blue book: ITU(CCITT) X.25 Recommendation (1988). The reference is 
specified in the REFERENCE section of an object.

Only BASIC CUGs are supported."

--  Route Table

--  Basically, a route entry consists of a source address and a destination.  
--  Four categories of destinations are available, providing 4 possible 
--  route types.  The are:

--  (1) Route to a specific upper SAP destination.

--  (2) Route to a specific lower SAP destination.  This type of route is 
--      ideal when targeting a specific data link connection (identified by 
--      the CES) on a LAPD link.  This type of route can also be used in 
--      place of the (2) "route to a logical link destination" when route 
--      balancing is not required, thus avoiding having to configure a 
--      logical link containing only 1 SAP entry.  In other words, its ideal 
--      for LAPB routing that required no load balancing.

--  (3) Route to a logical link destination.  A logical link is a group 
--      consisting of 1 or more specified lower SAPs which are grouped for 
--      the purpose of route balancing.

--  (4) Route to a hunt group destination.  A hunt group consists of 1 or

"This table contains Hunt Group definitions for the X.25 layer. A hunt

Additions to this table are offline only. To determine the list of active

Any incoming call whose address is determined to be associated with a hunt

the incoming call is routed to the first member of the hunt group. If this 
member refuses the call, the next member is attempted, and so on. If all 
members of a hunt group refuse the call, the call is refused back to its 
source.

Enabling hunt group rotation (x25HuntGroupRotation) causes hunting to 
begin with a different hunt group member each time. For example, a group 
with three members would be hunted as follows: 123, 231, 312, 123. Members 
are identified by x25HGMember Index.

"Indicates the current state at this side of the virtual circuit.

Options:
stateReady (1): 

SVC: Does not apply.

PVC: The PVC is configured. It remains in this state until a Restart 
Request or Restart Confirm is received. This means that the PVC is in 
limbo and cannot initiate its reset procedure until the restart procedure 
has completed. The restart procedure brings up the packet level at the 
port where the PVC exists.

stateConnecting (2)

SVC: The SAP has sent out a call and is waiting for a reply, or has 
received a call and is routing that call out to another SAP (lower or 
upper), and is also waiting for a reply.

PVC: Does not apply.

stateDataTransfer (3)

SVC: A connection has been accepted.

PVC: Reset procedure has been successful.

stateDisconnecting (4)

SVC: The SAP has sent out a clear and is waiting for a reply, or has 
received a clear and is routing that clear out to another SAP (lower or 
upper), and is also waiting for a reply. This state is only possible if 
the previous state was 'stateDataTransfer'.

PVC: Does not apply.

 This following paragraph applies to the next three states: When a 
connection is established (SVC or PVC), a 'connection block' is assigned 
to each side of the connection. One side is always termed as the 'called' 
side and the other the 'calling' side. For a PVC, the source side is 
always the 'calling' and the destination side is always the 'called'. For 
an SVC, the side that receives the call is the 'calling' side, and the 
other is the 'called'. This makes sense since we are routing the call 
towards the called user.

stateResettingCgSide (5) SVC/PVC: A reset was received at the called side. 
The called side confirms the reset at its side, and a reset is also sent 
to the calling side. Both sides enter this state awaiting a confirmation 
at the calling side.

state ResettingCdSide (6) SVC/PVC: A reset is received at the calling 
side. The calling side confirms the reset at its side, and a reset is also 
sent to the called side. Both sides enter this state awaiting a 
confirmation at the 'called' side.

stateResettingBoth (7) SVC/PVC: This state is entered when a reset is 
generated internally at both the calling and called sides. Both sides 
enter the this state, each while waiting for a confirmation."
