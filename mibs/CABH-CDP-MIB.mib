               This table has one row entry for each allocated

               valid cabhCdpLanAddrMethod, a cabhCdpLanAddrIpType, a
               unique cabhCdpLanAddrIp, and a unique
               cabhCdpLanAddrClientId value.

               Static/Manual address assignment: To create a new DHCP
               address reservation, the NMS creates a row with: an
               index comprised of a new cabhCdpLanAddrIp and its
               cabhCdpLanAddrIpType, a new unique
               cabhCdpLanAddrClientID, (an empty LeaseCreateTime and
               empty LeaseExpireTime,) and a
               cabhCdpLanDataAddrRowStatus of createAndGo(4).  If the
               syntax and values of the new row - indicating a
               reservation - are valid, the PS must set
               cabhCdpLanAddrMethod to reservationInactive(1) and
               cabhCdpLanDataAddrRowStatus to active(1).  When the PS
               grants a lease for a reserved IP, it must set the
               cabhCdpLanAddrMethod object for that row to
               reservationActive(2).  When a lease for a reserved IP
               expires, the PS must set the corresponding row's
               cabhCdpLanAddrMethod object to reservationInactive(1).
               For row entries that represent lease reservations - rows
               in which the cabhCdpLanAddrMethod object has a value of

               Dynamic address assignment:  When the PS grants a lease
               for a non-reserved IP, it must set the
               cabhCdpLanAddrMethod object for that row to
               dynamicActive(4).  When a lease for a non-reserved IP
               expires, the PS must set the corresponding row's
               cabhCdpLanAddrMethod object to dynamicInactive(3).  The
               PS must create new row entries using cabhCdpLanAddrIp
               values that are unique to this table.  If all
               cabhCdpLanAddrIp values in the range defined by
               cabhCdpLanPoolStart and cabhCdpLanPoolEnd are in use in

               value and use that cabhCdpLanAddrIp as part of a new
               lease.  For row entries that represent active leases -
