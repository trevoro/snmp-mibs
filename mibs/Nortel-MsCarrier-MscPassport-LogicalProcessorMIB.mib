-- LogicalProcessor/n
-- The LogicalProcessor (Lp) component is a root component. One Lp 
-- component is created for each Logical Processor. An Lp may be 
-- configured to run on up to two cards; one as the main card, and the 
-- other as the spare card. When two cards are configured, the Lp runs 
-- on one card, and waits for that card to fail before starting to run on 
-- the other card.

      level component has a CID of 0.
      
      Every operator session also has a CID, which is the CID 
      provisioned for the operator's user ID. An operator will see only the 
      stream data for components having a matching CID. Also, the 
      operator will be allowed to issue commands for only those 
      components which have a matching CID.
      
      An operator CID of 0 is used to identify the Network Manager 
      (referred to as 'NetMan' in DPN). This CID matches the CID of 
      any component. Values 1 to 8191 inclusive (equivalent to 'basic

      When no values are in the set, this indicates that either the attribute 
      is not supported or that none of the status conditions described 
      below are present.
      
      The value inTest indicates that the resource is undergoing a test 
      procedure. If adminState is locked or shuttingDown, the normal 
      users are precluded from using the resource and controlStatus is 
      reservedForTest. Tests that do not exclude additional users can be 
      present in any operational or administrative state but the 
      reservedForTest condition should not be present.
      
      The value failed indicates that the component has an internal fault 
      that prevents it from operating. The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value dependency indicates that the component cannot operate 
      because some other resource on which it depends is unavailable. 
      The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value powerOff indicates the resource requires power to be 
      applied and it is not powered on. The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value offLine indicates the resource requires a routine 
      operation (either manual, automatic, or both) to be performed to 
      place it on-line and make it available for use. The operationalState 
      is disabled.
      
      The value offDuty indicates the resource is inactive in accordance 
      with a predetermined time schedule. In the absence of other 
      disabling conditions, the operationalState is enabled or disabled.
      
      The value degraded indicates the service provided by the 
      component is degraded in some way, such as in speed or operating 
      capacity. However, the resource remains available for service. The 
      operationalState is enabled.

      The value initializationRequired indicates (for a resource which 
      doesn't initialize autonomously) that initialization is required before 
      it can perform its normal functions, and this procedure has not been 
      initiated. The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value notInitialized indicates (for a resource which does

      the use of a signal phase-locked to the CP reference clock.
      Note that the multiport cell-based cards have one common clock 
      source for all ports. For this reason, the following rules apply for the

      patternSyncFailed indicates that the local end failed to synchronize 
      to the frmPatternType test pattern, that should have been looped 
      back at the remote end. This failure indicates a high rate of 
      transmission errors or the absence of a loopback.
      
      patternSyncLost indicates that the local end gained and then lost 
      synchronization to the returned frmPatternType test pattern. This 
      failure indicates a sudden increase in transmission errors, frame 
      slippage, or the removal of an existing loopback.

      defects have been observed and accumulated for a period of time

      In ATM cell direct mapping mode, an LCD defect occurs when Out 
      of Cell Delineation (OCD) anomaly persists for x milliseconds, and 
      disappears when the Out of Cell Delineation (OCD) is absent for x 
      msec. An OCD anomaly occurs when 7 consecutive incorrect HECs

      consecutive correct HECs have been detected.
      For an AtmCell component located under a DS3 or E3 component 
      with mapping = PLCP, the LCD defect is directly derived from the 
      PLCP LOF defect.
      If LCD defects are intermittently occurring, the LCD defect 
      accumulator is decremented at a rate of 1/10 of the incrementing 
      rate (alarm integration ratio of 1/10), with all measurements based 
      on a 200 ms polling cycle
      The component under which is located the AtmCell component goes 
      into an operational state of disabled until the LCD alarm condition 
      is cleared. The condition is cleared after the LCD defect has not 
      been reported for a period of 10 seconds +/- 0.5 seconds.

      pattern used to request loopCode depends on the test type. This

      back at the remote end. This failure indicates a high rate of 
      transmission errors or the absence of a loopback.
      
      patternSyncLost indicates that the local end gained and then lost 
      synchronization to the returned frmPatternType test pattern. This

      defects have been observed and accumulated for a period of time 
      specified through the alarmActDelay attribute.
      In ATM cell direct mapping mode, an LCD defect occurs when Out 
      of Cell Delineation (OCD) anomaly persists for x milliseconds, and

      msec. An OCD anomaly occurs when 7 consecutive incorrect HECs

      consecutive correct HECs have been detected.
      For an AtmCell component located under a DS3 or E3 component 
      with mapping = PLCP, the LCD defect is directly derived from the 
      PLCP LOF defect.
      If LCD defects are intermittently occurring, the LCD defect

      rate (alarm integration ratio of 1/10), with all measurements based 
      on a 200 ms polling cycle
      The component under which is located the AtmCell component goes 
      into an operational state of disabled until the LCD alarm condition 
      is cleared. The condition is cleared after the LCD defect has not 
      been reported for a period of 10 seconds +/- 0.5 seconds.

      For all other card types, this attribute is the calculated bit error rate 
      on the link. Test data are generated and sent in frames of a preset 
      size (frameSize). The Test component will try to estimate the 
      number of bit errors in any errored frame which is identifiable. The

      an error on the flag sequence) will be discarded for the bit error rate 
      calculation. The result is presented in the form of xEsyy, where x is 
      the mantissa, syy is the exponent, for example 0E+00, 2E-09.

      For all other card types, this attribute is the calculated bit error rate 
      on the link. Test data are generated and sent in frames of a preset 
      size (frameSize). The Test component will try to estimate the 
      number of bit errors in any errored frame which is identifiable. The 
      statistics will be updated accordingly. A lost frame (may be due to 
      an error on the flag sequence) will be discarded for the bit error rate 
      calculation. The result is presented in the form of xEsyy, where x is 
      the mantissa, syy is the exponent, for example 0E+00, 2E-09.
      Note that the bitErrorRate is an estimate only. For more reliable test 
      results, the test should be done over a long period. Multiple tests 
      would also improve the confidence level of the test results."

      decremented at a rate of 1/12 (for DS3 PLCP) or 1/9 (for G.751 E3 
      PLCP) of the incrementing rate, with all measurements based on a

      event) is declared when an error is detected in both the A1 and A2 
      octets, or when two consecutive POHIDs are found in error.
      OOF is removed when two valid sets of framing octets and two 
      valid and sequential POHID octets have been found. The LOF 
      defect is removed when the defect counter reaches zero, i.e. when 
      OOF events are absent for more than 12 ms (DS3 PLCP) or 9 ms 
      (G.751 E3 PLCP). LOF failure alarm is cleared when LOF defect is

      For an AtmCell component located under a DS3 or E3 component

      When line is selected, the port synchronizes to the clock from the 
      facility.
      
      When module is selected, the ports clock synchronizes to the clock 
      provided by the oscillator on the active CP.
      
      When otherPort is selected, the port synchronizes to the port with a 
      clocking source of line.
      
      When srtsMode is selected, the port transmit frequency depends on 
      the SRTS (Synchronous Residual Time-Stamp) received over the 
      ATM network. SRTS information is also generated sent over the 
      ATM network.
      
      When adaptiveMode is selected, the port transmit frequency 
      continually adapts to match the egress data received from the ATM 
      network.
      
      A port with srtsMode or adaptiveMode must have a single Chan 
      which may be linked only to an Aal1Ces.service with serviceType

      otherPort is valid only on AAL1 cards. srtsMode is valid only on 
      AAL1 and Multi-Service Access cards. adaptiveMode is valid only

      the test's termination:
      
      neverStarted indicates that the test has not yet been started.
      
      testRunning indicates that the test has been started.
      
      stoppedByOperator indicates that the operator issued a stop 
      command on a test that was running.
      
      testTimeExpired indicates that the test ran for the time specified by 
      the test's duration.
      
      loopCodeSyncFailed indicates that the local end failed to 
      synchronize to the loopCode pattern. The local end transmits the 
      loopCode pattern to cause the remote end to apply a loopback, after 
      which the local end should receive the loopCode pattern. The exact 
      pattern used to request loopCode depends on the test type. This 
      failure indicates a high rate of transmission errors, or that the 
      remote end has failed to apply the loopback.
      
      patternSyncFailed indicates that the local end failed to synchronize 
      to the frmPatternType test pattern, that should have been looped 
      back at the remote end. This failure indicates a high rate of 
      transmission errors or the absence of a loopback.
      
      patternSyncLost indicates that the local end gained and then lost 
      synchronization to the returned frmPatternType test pattern. This 
      failure indicates a sudden increase in transmission errors, frame 
      slippage, or the removal of an existing loopback.
      
      unknown is set when a reason to terminate other than those listed 
      here is encountered.
      
      Note: Only MSA cards support recognition of the failures 
      loopCodeSyncFailed, patternSyncFailed and patternSyncLost. 
      Other cards will not terminate the test under the conditions 
      described by these values."

      size (frameSize). The Test component will try to estimate the 
      number of bit errors in any errored frame which is identifiable. The 
      statistics will be updated accordingly. A lost frame (may be due to 
      an error on the flag sequence) will be discarded for the bit error rate 
      calculation. The result is presented in the form of xEsyy, where x is 
      the mantissa, syy is the exponent, for example 0E+00, 2E-09.
      Note that the bitErrorRate is an estimate only. For more reliable test

      In ATM cell direct mapping mode, an LCD defect occurs when Out

      For an AtmCell component located under a DS3 or E3 component

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute indicates either the status of the test or the cause of

      neverStarted indicates that the test has not yet been started.

      the test's duration.
      
      loopCodeSyncFailed indicates that the local end failed to 
      synchronize to the loopCode pattern. The local end transmits the 
      loopCode pattern to cause the remote end to apply a loopback, after 
      which the local end should receive the loopCode pattern. The exact 
      pattern used to request loopCode depends on the test type. This 
      failure indicates a high rate of transmission errors, or that the 
      remote end has failed to apply the loopback.
      
      patternSyncFailed indicates that the local end failed to synchronize 
      to the frmPatternType test pattern, that should have been looped 
      back at the remote end. This failure indicates a high rate of 
      transmission errors or the absence of a loopback.
      
      patternSyncLost indicates that the local end gained and then lost 
      synchronization to the returned frmPatternType test pattern. This 
      failure indicates a sudden increase in transmission errors, frame 
      slippage, or the removal of an existing loopback.
      
      unknown is set when a reason to terminate other than those listed

      number of bit errors in any errored frame which is identifiable. The 
      statistics will be updated accordingly. A lost frame (may be due to 
      an error on the flag sequence) will be discarded for the bit error rate 
      calculation. The result is presented in the form of xEsyy, where x is 
      the mantissa, syy is the exponent, for example 0E+00, 2E-09.
      Note that the bitErrorRate is an estimate only. For more reliable test 
      results, the test should be done over a long period. Multiple tests 
      would also improve the confidence level of the test results."

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute defines the source of the transmit clock for the E1

      When local is selected, the crystal on the port generates the 
      clocking for the line.
      
      When line is selected, the port synchronizes to the clock from the 
      facility.
      
      When module is selected, the ports clock synchronizes to the clock 
      provided by the oscillator on the active CP.
      
      When otherPort is selected, the port synchronizes to the port with a 
      clocking source of line.
      
      When srtsMode is selected, the port transmit frequency depends on 
      the SRTS (Synchronous Residual Time-Stamp) received over the 
      ATM network. SRTS information is also generated sent over the 
      ATM network.
      
      When adaptiveMode is selected, the port transmit frequency 
      continually adapts to match the egress data received from the ATM 
      network.
      
      A port with srtsMode or adaptiveMode must have a single Chan 
      which may be linked only to an Aal1Ces.service with serviceType 
      unstructured 
      
      If the NetworkSynchronization component is present, the default 
      value of this attribute is module, otherwise it defaults to line, except 
      for the 3pE1Atm card, which it defaults to local.
      On a 3pE1Atm card all ports must have the same value, and be 
      either local or module.
      
      otherPort is valid only on AAL1 cards. srtsMode is valid only on 
      AAL1 and Multi-Service Access cards. adaptiveMode is valid only 
      on Multi-Service Access cards.
      
      On 4E1Aal1 cards either:
      
      all four ports' clockingSource values must be local OR
      all four ports' clockingSource values must be module OR
      one port's clockingSource value must be line and the other three

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute selects the data rate of the timeslots in a channel of a 
      DS1 component. For E1, the data rate of the timeslots will always 
      be 64kbit/s regardless of this attribute.
      When doNotOverride is selected for a channel on a DS1, the data 
      rate of the channel's timeslots are dependant on the zeroCoding 
      selection of the DS1 component. If the zeroCoding is B8ZS (where 
      supported on the FP) or none, the timeslot's data rate will be 64kbit/
      s. If the zeroCoding option is bit7Stuffing, the data rate of a timeslot 
      will be 56kbit/s.
      When 56k is selected for a channel on a DS1, the least significant 
      bit of each timeslot of this Channel will always be set to 1 and not 
      used for data. The data rate for the timeslots of this channel is 
      therefore restricted to 56kbit/s.
      One application of this attribute is to allow a DS1 line to support 
      mixing channels that originate from lines that use different 
      zeroCoding schemes."

      operator will be allowed to issue commands for only those 
      components which have a matching CID.
      
      An operator CID of 0 is used to identify the Network Manager

      loopCode pattern to cause the remote end to apply a loopback, after 
      which the local end should receive the loopCode pattern. The exact 
      pattern used to request loopCode depends on the test type. This 
      failure indicates a high rate of transmission errors, or that the 
      remote end has failed to apply the loopback.
      
      patternSyncFailed indicates that the local end failed to synchronize 
      to the frmPatternType test pattern, that should have been looped 
      back at the remote end. This failure indicates a high rate of 
      transmission errors or the absence of a loopback.
      
      patternSyncLost indicates that the local end gained and then lost 
      synchronization to the returned frmPatternType test pattern. This

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute is not displayed for ATM cards because the physical 
      layer drops all errored frames at the controller interface. 
      
      For all other card types, this attribute is the calculated bit error rate 
      on the link. Test data are generated and sent in frames of a preset 
      size (frameSize). The Test component will try to estimate the 
      number of bit errors in any errored frame which is identifiable. The 
      statistics will be updated accordingly. A lost frame (may be due to 
      an error on the flag sequence) will be discarded for the bit error rate 
      calculation. The result is presented in the form of xEsyy, where x is 
      the mantissa, syy is the exponent, for example 0E+00, 2E-09.
      Note that the bitErrorRate is an estimate only. For more reliable test 
      results, the test should be done over a long period. Multiple tests 
      would also improve the confidence level of the test results."

     "This attribute indicates either the status of the test or the cause of

      neverStarted indicates that the test has not yet been started.

      synchronize to the loopCode pattern. The local end transmits the 
      loopCode pattern to cause the remote end to apply a loopback, after 
      which the local end should receive the loopCode pattern. The exact 
      pattern used to request loopCode depends on the test type. This 
      failure indicates a high rate of transmission errors, or that the 
      remote end has failed to apply the loopback.
      
      patternSyncFailed indicates that the local end failed to synchronize 
      to the frmPatternType test pattern, that should have been looped 
      back at the remote end. This failure indicates a high rate of 
      transmission errors or the absence of a loopback.
      
      patternSyncLost indicates that the local end gained and then lost 
      synchronization to the returned frmPatternType test pattern. This 
      failure indicates a sudden increase in transmission errors, frame 
      slippage, or the removal of an existing loopback.
      
      unknown is set when a reason to terminate other than those listed 
      here is encountered.

      loopCodeSyncFailed, patternSyncFailed and patternSyncLost.

      an error on the flag sequence) will be discarded for the bit error rate 
      calculation. The result is presented in the form of xEsyy, where x is 
      the mantissa, syy is the exponent, for example 0E+00, 2E-09.
      Note that the bitErrorRate is an estimate only. For more reliable test

      loopCode pattern to cause the remote end to apply a loopback, after 
      which the local end should receive the loopCode pattern. The exact 
      pattern used to request loopCode depends on the test type. This 
      failure indicates a high rate of transmission errors, or that the 
      remote end has failed to apply the loopback.
      
      patternSyncFailed indicates that the local end failed to synchronize 
      to the frmPatternType test pattern, that should have been looped 
      back at the remote end. This failure indicates a high rate of 
      transmission errors or the absence of a loopback.
      
      patternSyncLost indicates that the local end gained and then lost 
      synchronization to the returned frmPatternType test pattern. This 
      failure indicates a sudden increase in transmission errors, frame 
      slippage, or the removal of an existing loopback.
      
      unknown is set when a reason to terminate other than those listed

      For all other card types, this attribute is the calculated bit error rate 
      on the link. Test data are generated and sent in frames of a preset 
      size (frameSize). The Test component will try to estimate the 
      number of bit errors in any errored frame which is identifiable. The 
      statistics will be updated accordingly. A lost frame (may be due to 
      an error on the flag sequence) will be discarded for the bit error rate 
      calculation. The result is presented in the form of xEsyy, where x is 
      the mantissa, syy is the exponent, for example 0E+00, 2E-09.
      Note that the bitErrorRate is an estimate only. For more reliable test

      loopCode pattern to cause the remote end to apply a loopback, after 
      which the local end should receive the loopCode pattern. The exact 
      pattern used to request loopCode depends on the test type. This 
      failure indicates a high rate of transmission errors, or that the 
      remote end has failed to apply the loopback.
      
      patternSyncFailed indicates that the local end failed to synchronize 
      to the frmPatternType test pattern, that should have been looped 
      back at the remote end. This failure indicates a high rate of 
      transmission errors or the absence of a loopback.
      
      patternSyncLost indicates that the local end gained and then lost 
      synchronization to the returned frmPatternType test pattern. This 
      failure indicates a sudden increase in transmission errors, frame 
      slippage, or the removal of an existing loopback.
      
      unknown is set when a reason to terminate other than those listed

      an error on the flag sequence) will be discarded for the bit error rate 
      calculation. The result is presented in the form of xEsyy, where x is 
      the mantissa, syy is the exponent, for example 0E+00, 2E-09.
      Note that the bitErrorRate is an estimate only. For more reliable test

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute defines the type of clocking source used for 
      synchronizing the OC-3 transmit clock: local means direct use of 
      the local clock oscillator at its centre frequency; line means the use 
      of a signal phase-locked to the incoming OC-3 line rate; module 
      means the use of a signal phase-locked to the CP reference clock. 
      When adding a Sonet/Sdh component, the clockingSource attribute 
      is set to module if the NetworkSynchronization component has 
      been added and is set to local otherwise.
      Note that the multiport OC-3 cell-based cards has one common 
      clock source for each of the three ports when either the clocking 
      source local or module is selected. For this reason, it is not allowed 
      to have at the same time the clockingSource attribute set to local on 
      one port and module on another port. Furthermore, the 
      clockingSource attribute cannot be set to module if the 
      NetworkSynchronization component has not been added."

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute holds the Customer Identifier (CID).
      
      Every component has a CID. If a component has a cid attribute, the 
      component's CID is the provisioned value of that attribute; 
      otherwise the component inherits the CID of its parent. The top-
      level component has a CID of 0.
      
      Every operator session also has a CID, which is the CID 
      provisioned for the operator's user ID. An operator will see only the 
      stream data for components having a matching CID. Also, the 
      operator will be allowed to issue commands for only those 
      components which have a matching CID.
      
      An operator CID of 0 is used to identify the Network Manager 
      (referred to as 'NetMan' in DPN). This CID matches the CID of 
      any component. Values 1 to 8191 inclusive (equivalent to 'basic 
      CIDs' in DPN) may be assigned to specific customers."

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute indicates whether a Loss Of Signal (LOS) alarm state 
      has been entered. An LOS alarm state is entered when LOS defects 
      have been observed and accumulated for a period of 2.5 seconds +/- 
      0.5 seconds, or if an LOS defect is present when the criteria for 
      LOF failure declaration have been met. A LOS defect is declared 
      when 20+/-3 us of all-zeros pattern is detected. The LOS defect is 
      cleared when two valid framing words are detected and no Loss Of 
      Signal condition is detected during an interval of 20+/-3 us. If the 
      LOS defects are intermittently occurring, the LOS defect 
      accumulator is decremented at a rate of 1/10 of the incrementing 
      rate (alarm integration ratio of 1/10), with all measurements based 
      on a 200 ms polling cycle.
      The Sonet/Sdh component goes into an operational state of disabled

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute holds the Customer Identifier (CID).
      
      Every component has a CID. If a component has a cid attribute, the 
      component's CID is the provisioned value of that attribute; 
      otherwise the component inherits the CID of its parent. The top-
      level component has a CID of 0.
      
      Every operator session also has a CID, which is the CID 
      provisioned for the operator's user ID. An operator will see only the 
      stream data for components having a matching CID. Also, the 
      operator will be allowed to issue commands for only those 
      components which have a matching CID.
      
      An operator CID of 0 is used to identify the Network Manager 
      (referred to as 'NetMan' in DPN). This CID matches the CID of 
      any component. Values 1 to 8191 inclusive (equivalent to 'basic 
      CIDs' in DPN) may be assigned to specific customers."

      For an AtmCell component located under a DS3 or E3 component 
      with mapping = PLCP, the LCD defect is directly derived from the 
      PLCP LOF defect.
      If LCD defects are intermittently occurring, the LCD defect 
      accumulator is decremented at a rate of 1/10 of the incrementing 
      rate (alarm integration ratio of 1/10), with all measurements based 
      on a 200 ms polling cycle
      The component under which is located the AtmCell component goes 
      into an operational state of disabled until the LCD alarm condition 
      is cleared. The condition is cleared after the LCD defect has not 
      been reported for a period of 10 seconds +/- 0.5 seconds.
      The lcdAlarm attribute is always set to off when the parent of the 
      AtmCell component has been locked and left offline. This can also 
      happen when the Path or Channel component has been suspended 
      since its parent has been locked."

      loopCode pattern to cause the remote end to apply a loopback, after 
      which the local end should receive the loopCode pattern. The exact 
      pattern used to request loopCode depends on the test type. This 
      failure indicates a high rate of transmission errors, or that the 
      remote end has failed to apply the loopback.
      
      patternSyncFailed indicates that the local end failed to synchronize 
      to the frmPatternType test pattern, that should have been looped 
      back at the remote end. This failure indicates a high rate of 
      transmission errors or the absence of a loopback.
      
      patternSyncLost indicates that the local end gained and then lost 
      synchronization to the returned frmPatternType test pattern. This 
      failure indicates a sudden increase in transmission errors, frame 
      slippage, or the removal of an existing loopback.
      
      unknown is set when a reason to terminate other than those listed 
      here is encountered.
      
      Note: Only MSA cards support recognition of the failures 
      loopCodeSyncFailed, patternSyncFailed and patternSyncLost. 
      Other cards will not terminate the test under the conditions 
      described by these values."

      For all other card types, this attribute is the calculated bit error rate 
      on the link. Test data are generated and sent in frames of a preset 
      size (frameSize). The Test component will try to estimate the 
      number of bit errors in any errored frame which is identifiable. The 
      statistics will be updated accordingly. A lost frame (may be due to 
      an error on the flag sequence) will be discarded for the bit error rate 
      calculation. The result is presented in the form of xEsyy, where x is 
      the mantissa, syy is the exponent, for example 0E+00, 2E-09.
      Note that the bitErrorRate is an estimate only. For more reliable test 
      results, the test should be done over a long period. Multiple tests 
      would also improve the confidence level of the test results."

      defects have been observed and accumulated for a period of time

      In ATM cell direct mapping mode, an LCD defect occurs when Out 
      of Cell Delineation (OCD) anomaly persists for x milliseconds, and

      For an AtmCell component located under a DS3 or E3 component 
      with mapping = PLCP, the LCD defect is directly derived from the 
      PLCP LOF defect.

      on a 200 ms polling cycle
      The component under which is located the AtmCell component goes 
      into an operational state of disabled until the LCD alarm condition 
      is cleared. The condition is cleared after the LCD defect has not 
      been reported for a period of 10 seconds +/- 0.5 seconds.

      manual test assumes the line is looped back externally and a bit 
      error rate test is performed.
      localLoop test loops back the local modem and performs a bit error 
      rate test.
      remoteLoop test loops back the remote modem (or CSU) and 
      performs a bit error rate test.
      externalLoop test loops back the line to the far end.
      payloadLoop test only loops back the payload data received from 
      the incoming line.
      remoteLoopThisTrib loops this particular tributary back at the far 
      end, using services provided by the parent.
      v54RemoteLoop initiates a V.54 Remote Loopback test.
      pn127RemoteLoop initiates a PN127 Remote Loopback test.

      synchronize to the loopCode pattern. The local end transmits the 
      loopCode pattern to cause the remote end to apply a loopback, after 
      which the local end should receive the loopCode pattern. The exact 
      pattern used to request loopCode depends on the test type. This 
      failure indicates a high rate of transmission errors, or that the 
      remote end has failed to apply the loopback.
      
      patternSyncFailed indicates that the local end failed to synchronize 
      to the frmPatternType test pattern, that should have been looped 
      back at the remote end. This failure indicates a high rate of 
      transmission errors or the absence of a loopback.
      
      patternSyncLost indicates that the local end gained and then lost 
      synchronization to the returned frmPatternType test pattern. This 
      failure indicates a sudden increase in transmission errors, frame 
      slippage, or the removal of an existing loopback.
      
      unknown is set when a reason to terminate other than those listed

      number of bit errors in any errored frame which is identifiable. The 
      statistics will be updated accordingly. A lost frame (may be due to 
      an error on the flag sequence) will be discarded for the bit error rate 
      calculation. The result is presented in the form of xEsyy, where x is 
      the mantissa, syy is the exponent, for example 0E+00, 2E-09.
      Note that the bitErrorRate is an estimate only. For more reliable test

      loopCodeSyncFailed indicates that the local end failed to 
      synchronize to the loopCode pattern. The local end transmits the 
      loopCode pattern to cause the remote end to apply a loopback, after 
      which the local end should receive the loopCode pattern. The exact 
      pattern used to request loopCode depends on the test type. This 
      failure indicates a high rate of transmission errors, or that the 
      remote end has failed to apply the loopback.
      
      patternSyncFailed indicates that the local end failed to synchronize 
      to the frmPatternType test pattern, that should have been looped 
      back at the remote end. This failure indicates a high rate of 
      transmission errors or the absence of a loopback.
      
      patternSyncLost indicates that the local end gained and then lost 
      synchronization to the returned frmPatternType test pattern. This 
      failure indicates a sudden increase in transmission errors, frame 
      slippage, or the removal of an existing loopback.
      
      unknown is set when a reason to terminate other than those listed 
      here is encountered.
      
      Note: Only MSA cards support recognition of the failures 
      loopCodeSyncFailed, patternSyncFailed and patternSyncLost.

      number of bit errors in any errored frame which is identifiable. The 
      statistics will be updated accordingly. A lost frame (may be due to 
      an error on the flag sequence) will be discarded for the bit error rate 
      calculation. The result is presented in the form of xEsyy, where x is 
      the mantissa, syy is the exponent, for example 0E+00, 2E-09.

      defects have been observed and accumulated for a period of time

      In ATM cell direct mapping mode, an LCD defect occurs when Out 
      of Cell Delineation (OCD) anomaly persists for x milliseconds, and 
      disappears when the Out of Cell Delineation (OCD) is absent for x 
      msec. An OCD anomaly occurs when 7 consecutive incorrect HECs

      consecutive correct HECs have been detected.
      For an AtmCell component located under a DS3 or E3 component 
      with mapping = PLCP, the LCD defect is directly derived from the 
      PLCP LOF defect.
      If LCD defects are intermittently occurring, the LCD defect 
      accumulator is decremented at a rate of 1/10 of the incrementing 
      rate (alarm integration ratio of 1/10), with all measurements based 
      on a 200 ms polling cycle
      The component under which is located the AtmCell component goes 
      into an operational state of disabled until the LCD alarm condition 
      is cleared. The condition is cleared after the LCD defect has not

      failure indicates a high rate of transmission errors, or that the 
      remote end has failed to apply the loopback.
      
      patternSyncFailed indicates that the local end failed to synchronize 
      to the frmPatternType test pattern, that should have been looped 
      back at the remote end. This failure indicates a high rate of 
      transmission errors or the absence of a loopback.
      
      patternSyncLost indicates that the local end gained and then lost 
      synchronization to the returned frmPatternType test pattern. This 
      failure indicates a sudden increase in transmission errors, frame 
      slippage, or the removal of an existing loopback.
      
      unknown is set when a reason to terminate other than those listed 
      here is encountered.
      
      Note: Only MSA cards support recognition of the failures 
      loopCodeSyncFailed, patternSyncFailed and patternSyncLost. 
      Other cards will not terminate the test under the conditions 
      described by these values."

      For all other card types, this attribute is the calculated bit error rate 
      on the link. Test data are generated and sent in frames of a preset 
      size (frameSize). The Test component will try to estimate the 
      number of bit errors in any errored frame which is identifiable. The 
      statistics will be updated accordingly. A lost frame (may be due to 
      an error on the flag sequence) will be discarded for the bit error rate 
      calculation. The result is presented in the form of xEsyy, where x is 
      the mantissa, syy is the exponent, for example 0E+00, 2E-09.
      Note that the bitErrorRate is an estimate only. For more reliable test 
      results, the test should be done over a long period. Multiple tests 
      would also improve the confidence level of the test results."
