	-- Ascend Event group
	--
	-- This group contains a table of events.  The table is
	-- organized in a "ring" buffer fashion.  That is, when
	-- table is full, a new event will overwrite the oldest
	-- event in the table.
	--
	-- Each event is assigned a unique ID number which is also
	-- used as the "index" into the table.	The ID number
	-- increments successively by 1 for each new event.
	--
	-- SNMP should periodically poll this table and retrieve new
	-- events.  The poll scenario is as follows:
	--
	--    1.  Manager retrieves 'eventLatestEventIdNumber' and
	--	  compares it against the value retrieved from the
	--	  previous poll cycle.	No difference implies no
	--	  new events have occured and manager takes no
	--	  further action.  If theres a difference then the
	--	  magnitude of the difference indicates the number
	--	  of new events that have occured and needs to be
	--	  retrieved.
	--    2.  Manager retrieves the new events starting with
	--	  event ID 1 greater than the last one it read.
	--    3.  After retrieving the last event, manager saves
	--	  the event's ID number locally so it can be used
	--	  for comparison on the next poll cycle.
	--
	-- Depending on how often a manager polls this table, it is
	-- possible for the number of unread events to exceed the
	-- table's capacity (given in 'eventMaximumNumberOfEvents').
	-- Since table is organized as a "ring" buffer, retrieving
	-- the oldest unread entries may result in a noSuchName error.
	--
	-- Also note that event IDs may wrap around.  This should be taken
	-- into consideration when determining the number of new events.
	-- If wrap around occurs ('eventOldestEventIdNumber' is greater
	-- than 'eventLatestEventIdNumber') and manager is doing GET-NEXTs
	-- then note that some of the newer events will be retrieve first
	-- before older ones.
	--
	-- Information held in this group is NOT saved across power ups or
	-- restarts.  In particular, event ID assignments will start off at
	-- 1 and not from the last one assigned.  It is highly recommended
	-- that 'sysAbsoluteStartupTime' be retrieved at the start of every
	-- poll cycle.	Comparing it against the previous poll's value will
	-- indicate whether unit restarted or not.
