      Note that this is a non-standard value, used because the original

      provide a value to indicate that none of the other three are 
      applicable.
      
      The value hotStandby indicates that the resource is not providing 
      service but will be immediately able to take over the role of the 
      resource to be backed up, without initialization activity, and 
      containing the same information as the resource to be backed up.
      
      The value coldStandby indicates the resource is a backup for 
      another resource but will not be immediately able to take over the 
      role of the backed up resource and will require some initialization 
      activity.
      
      The value providingService indicates that this component, as a
