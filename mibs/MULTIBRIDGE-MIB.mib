--      A meeting was held on 97.03.24 to review MultiBridge.mib, the area
--      interface definition for the Bridging area in the system region.
--      Attendees are marked with * in the TO and CC lists above.
--
--      Outcome
--
--      It was the consensus of the review team that this file is
--      acceptable with the indicated modifications.
--
--      Actions:
--      A1 -    M. Dubois to update the file as indicated in D1 below.
--              To be completed by 97.03.25
--              Response:

--      A2 -    M. Dubois to remove port from index in Static table

--              To be completed by 97.03.25
--              Response: the port id is part of the OID in order to add
--              new addresses by using one command:
--               mBrdgStaticAddress.<Bridge>.<MAC Address><PortId>, value=<MAC>
