--  Global group

--  The group consisting of parameters which are layer-wide in scope.
--
--  The first four objects within the group are used to perform translations between DXI circuit DFAs and ATM
--  circuit VPI/VCIs.
--
--  The first object identifies the supported MIB module version.
--
--  The next four objects provide a calculator-like functionality and do not impose configuration or storage of 
--  any sort.
--
--  Dxi Frame Address (DFA) is the mechanism used to identify a DXI circuit, and must be unique per port.
--
--  The combination of Virtual Path Identifier (VPI) and Virtual Channel identifier (VCI) is the mechanism
--  used to identify an ATM circuit, and must be unique per port.
