        segments are supported, although multi-
        point-to-point and point-to-multi-point
        connections are supported by an LSR acting
        as a cross-connect.  Each tunnel can thus

       "This bitmask indicates optional parameters

        direct to signaled values (for example
        SESSION_ATTRIBUTES flags in RSVP-TE).
        Others describe qualities of the tunnel.
        The following describes these bitfields:
        localProtectionDesired
        This flag permits transit routers to use a
        local repair mechanism which may result in
        violation of the explicit route object.
        When a fault is detected on an adjacent
        downstream link or node, a transit router
        can reroute traffic for fast service
        restoration.

        labelRecordingDesired
        This flag indicates that label information
        should be included when doing a route
        record.  This bit is not valid unless the
        recordRoute bit is set.

        seStyleDesired
        This flag indicates that the tunnel ingress
        node may choose to reroute this tunnel
        without tearing it down.
        When signaling uses RSVP, a tunnel egress
        node SHOULD use the SE Style when
        responding with a Resv message."

        link layer protection.

        shared
        Indicates that a shared link layer
        protection scheme, such as 1:N

        LSP.

        dedicatedOneToOne

        dedicatedOnePlusOne
        Indicates that a dedicated link layer
        protection scheme, i.e., 1+1 protection,
        should be used to support the LSP.

        enhanced

   DESCRIPTION
       "Compliance statement for agents that
        support the GMPLS TE MIB."
   MODULE -- this module

   -- The mandatory group has to be implemented by all
   -- LSRs that originate/terminate ESLSPs/tunnels.
   -- In addition, depending on the type of tunnels
   -- supported, other groups become mandatory as
   -- explained below.

   MANDATORY-GROUPS {
   gmplsTunnelGroup,
   gmplsTunnelScalarGroup
   }

   GROUP gmplsTunnelManualGroup
   DESCRIPTION
       "This group is mandatory for devices which
        support manual configuration of tunnels, in
        addition to gmplsTunnelGroup.  The
        following constraints apply:
        gmplsTunnelSignallingProto should be at
        least read-only with a value of none(1)."

   GROUP gmplsTunnelSignaledGroup
   DESCRIPTION
       "This group is mandatory for devices which
        support signaled tunnel set up, in addition
        to gmplsTunnelGroup.  The following
        constraints apply:
        gmplsTunnelSignallingProto should be at
        least read-only returning a value of
        ldp(2), or rsvp(3)."

   GROUP gmplsTunnelIsNotIntfcGroup
   DESCRIPTION
       "This group is mandatory for devices which
        support tunnels that are not interfaces, in
        addition to gmplsTunnelGroup.  The
        following constraints apply:
        gmplsTunnelIsIf must at least be read-only
        returning no(0)."

   GROUP gmplsTunnelIsIntfcGroup
   DESCRIPTION
       "This group is mandatory for devices which
        support tunnels that are interfaces, in
        addition to gmplsTunnelGroup.  The
        following constraints apply:
        gmplsTunnelIsUnnum must at least be read-
        only returning false."
