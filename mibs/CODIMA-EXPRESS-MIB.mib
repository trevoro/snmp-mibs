     DESCRIPTION
          "This Trap notification defines an network event detected
          by the CODIMA Express monitor alarm system.          
          The payload is as follows.  
          alarmMessage:  A textural description of an event.
          alarmLayer:  The OSI Network Layer associated with this event.
          alarmTopProtocol:  The upper OSI Network layer protocol associated with this event
          For example: SNMP, FTP.
          alarmBaseProtocol:  The lower OSI Network layer protocol associated with this event.
          For example: IP, IPX.
          alarmCode:  The Code number associated with this event.
          alarmFunction:  A range of Functions that apply to a particular Alarm Group.
          For example: The Discovered Group covers the application of discovering 
          the MAC addresses, IP addresses and Unit Type information logged.
          alarmGroup:  Alarm Groups are used to group a specific range of event reports,
          each group has a range of functions. The grouping is generally 
          based on either a protocol component, a network type or the 
          application associated with the event report. For example:- 
          The Discovered Group covers the application of discovering 
          the MAC addresses, IP addresses and Unit Type information logged.
          alarmUnitType:  The unit type is the type of the device that generated this event,
          e.g. Bridge, Workstation, File Server.
          alarmClass:  The severity of this alarm.  One of the four following levels are included:
          Critical:  The highest priority level alarm log report classification 
                     (usually applied to SNMP reports which are to be converted into Traps). 
          Alarm:     The second highest priority level alarm log report classification 
                     (usually applied to potentially dangerous situations such a breaches 
                      in statistical thresholds or Echo and Activity Test Failures). 
          Warning:   The second lowest priority level alarm log report classification 
                     (usually applied to most of the reports associated with the Expert System). 
          Event:     The lowest priority level alarm log report classification 
                     (usually applied to the logging of useful information, such as the 
                      discovery of an IP address or a new Node on the Network).
          alarmTime: The UTC time of when this event was issued.
          The value is in the format 'dd/mmm/yyyy hh:mm:ss'.
          The time (hh:mm:ss) is expressed as a 24-hour clock.
          The date (dd/mmm/yyyy) format uses 3 letter abbreviations for the month.
