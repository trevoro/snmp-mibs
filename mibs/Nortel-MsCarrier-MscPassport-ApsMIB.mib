     "This attribute holds the Customer Identifier (CID).
      
      Every component has a CID. If a component has a cid attribute, the

      otherwise the component inherits the CID of its parent. The top-
      level component has a CID of 0.
      
      Every operator session also has a CID, which is the CID 
      provisioned for the operator's user ID. An operator will see only the 
      stream data for components having a matching CID. Also, the 
      operator will be allowed to issue commands for only those 
      components which have a matching CID.
      
      An operator CID of 0 is used to identify the Network Manager 
      (referred to as 'NetMan' in DPN). This CID matches the CID of 
      any component. Values 1 to 8191 inclusive (equivalent to 'basic 
      CIDs' in DPN) may be assigned to specific customers."

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute is a link to the Path component whose parent Sonet or 
      Sdh component provides the Aps' working line. A value must be 
      defined for this component.
      
      The working line must exist under the same Lp as the protection 
      line and must link to a Path component under the same type of port 
      component (Sonet or Sdh) as the protection line.
      
      Valid workingLine and protectionLine pairs must exist. For the 
      1pOC12SmLrAtm card, the workingLine must be lp/n sonet/0 path/

      and must link to a Path component under the same type of port 
      component (Sonet or Sdh) as the protection line.

   DESCRIPTION

      The unidirectional mode allows the Aps to decide independently of 
      the far end which channel, either working or protection, will be 
      active for receive.
      
      The bidirectional mode instructs the Aps to decide jointly with the 
      far end which channel, either working or protection, will be active 
      for receive.
      
      Note that while an Aps Test is being run the Aps will operate in

      When this attribute is yes, the Aps will revert the receive active line 
      from protection back to working when a working line request is 
      cleared, after the provisioned waitToRestorePeriod has expired.

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute specifies the minimum bit error ratio (BER) for which 
      a Signal Degrade failure is declared. Its value is the exponent of the 
      BER, with possible values of -5 through -9 inclusive, which 
      correspond to a BER range of 10-5 through 10-9.
      
      The switch initiation time for a Signal Degrade varies depending on 
      the observed BER (not the provisioned signalDegradeRatio), as 
      described in the following table.
      
      Observed BER	Switch Initiation Time
      10-3	10 milliseconds
      10-4	100 milliseconds
      10-5	1 second
      10-6	10 seconds
      10-7	100 seconds
      10-8	16 minutes 40 seconds
      10-9	2 hours 46 minutes 40 seconds
      
      The clearing threshold for a Signal Degrade is one-tenth the 
      signalDegradeRatio; for example, if the provisioned 
      signalDegradeRatio is -5, the corresponding clearing threshold will 
      be 10-6. The clearing time varies depending on the clearing 
      threshold (not the observed BER), and can be determined from the 
      above table."

      the incoming line.

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute indicates either the status of the test or the cause of

      synchronize to the loopCode pattern. The local end transmits the 
      loopCode pattern to cause the remote end to apply a loopback, after 
      which the local end should receive the loopCode pattern. The exact 
      pattern used to request loopCode depends on the test type. This 
      failure indicates a high rate of transmission errors, or that the 
      remote end has failed to apply the loopback.
      
      patternSyncFailed indicates that the local end failed to synchronize 
      to the frmPatternType test pattern, that should have been looped 
      back at the remote end. This failure indicates a high rate of 
      transmission errors or the absence of a loopback.
      
      patternSyncLost indicates that the local end gained and then lost 
      synchronization to the returned frmPatternType test pattern. This 
      failure indicates a sudden increase in transmission errors, frame 
      slippage, or the removal of an existing loopback.
      
      unknown is set when a reason to terminate other than those listed 
      here is encountered.
      
      Note: Only MSA cards support recognition of the failures 
      loopCodeSyncFailed, patternSyncFailed and patternSyncLost.

      For all other card types, this attribute is the calculated bit error rate 
      on the link. Test data are generated and sent in frames of a preset 
      size (frameSize). The Test component will try to estimate the 
      number of bit errors in any errored frame which is identifiable. The 
      statistics will be updated accordingly. A lost frame (may be due to 
      an error on the flag sequence) will be discarded for the bit error rate 
      calculation. The result is presented in the form of xEsyy, where x is 
      the mantissa, syy is the exponent, for example 0E+00, 2E-09.
      Note that the bitErrorRate is an estimate only. For more reliable test 
      results, the test should be done over a long period. Multiple tests 
      would also improve the confidence level of the test results."
