ConformanceLevel ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS current
    DESCRIPTION
            "An indication of the conformance level for a particular set
            of MIB objects.

            The value 'noConf' indicates that the agent does not
            implement any of the required semantics for the associated
            set of objects.  Usually this means the object is not
            implemented at all.  However, it also indicates the special
            case in which incorrect values are returned, e.g., counter
            objects that always return zero, string objects that always
            return a zero-length string (but should not), hard-wired
            (potentially incorrect) enumerations or gauges.

            The value 'otherConf' indicates that the implementation
            complies with the semantics of the associated set of objects
            in a manner that varies from the specification in some way.

            The value 'minConf' indicates that the implementation
            complies with the semantics of the associated set of objects
            as refined by a GROUP clause or an OBJECT clause within a
            MODULE-COMPLIANCE macro.

            The value 'fullConf' indicates that the implementation
            complies with the semantics of the associated set of objects
            as defined by an indicated compliance statement for the set
            of objects.

            The value 'completeConf' indicates that the implementation
            complies with the full semantics of the associated set of
            objects as defined by the data definitions for the objects.
            This may be greater than than the conformance level
            indicated by the 'fullConf' enumeration if the indicated
            compliance statement does not require full implementation of
            the entire set of objects."

       "RFC 2580, section 5."

            value as the SYNTAX clause within a VARIATION clause of an
            AGENT-CAPABILITIES macro.

            If the associated capsConfLevel object is equal to
            'minConf', and this entry identifies a set of MIB objects,
            then this string MAY identify the applicable GROUP clause(s)
            associated with the entry.
            For all entries in which the associated capsConfLevel object
            is equal to 'minConf', this string SHOULD contain the same
            value as the SYNTAX, WRITE-SYNTAX, and/or MIN-ACCESS clauses
            present within the OBJECT clause of a MODULE-COMPLIANCE
            macro. The actual keyword (e.g., 'SYNTAX') SHOULD precede
            the quoted string value.  Multiple clauses MAY be
            concatenated within a single string, and SHOULD be separated
            by whitespace.  If this entry identifies multiple objects,
            then the same clause(s) must apply to all objects.

            The agent MAY return a zero-length string instead of a
            noSuchInstance exception."
