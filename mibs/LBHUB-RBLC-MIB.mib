-- This is the 3Com-ised version of the SpiderMIB:
-- The spider Group
--
--   The Spider enterprise node is split into several functional groups.
--   These are intended to be common to all Spider products, giving one
--   MIB for every product, and composite MIBs for groups of products.

bicctech	OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { enterprises 170 }
bdn		OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { bicctech 1 }
bdnII		OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { bdn 1 }
spiderII	OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { bdnII 3 }

-- spProduct:
--
--   This contains the Spider product-specific MIB groups.  A separate
--   group exists for each main class of Spider product (bridge, tserver,
--   router, probe, software), in which a product subtree is populated with
--   data common to more than one device of that class (all SpiderBridges,
--   for example).  In addition, the product trees contain a subtree for
--   EACH device, allowing the user to associate data with one particular
--   bridge, for example.

spProduct	OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=	{ spiderII 1 }

-- spIndex:
--
--   This is used by Spider products to indicate to the management station
--   those groups that are supported in products such as multi-protocol
--   terminal servers or multi-interface routers, and between revisions of
--   products.
--
--   Note that as of SpiderMIB-II (June 1992), the 'spIndex' group is
--   deprecated (we will use the forthcoming agent capability MIB data).

spIndex		OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=	{ spiderII 2 }

-- spGeneral:
--
--   All Spider products, whatever their type, share a variety of data,
--   held in the general group.  On a per-variable level the products
--   implement parts of the subtrees of this group, according to their
--   capabilities non-booting devices don't support the 'restart' group,
--   for example.)

spGeneral	OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=	{ spiderII 3 }

-- spSnmp:
--
--   For historical reasons (our MIB appeared long before any working
--   groups were set up to consider trap handling, for example) we have a
--   set of extensions to the basic SNMP administration variables,
--   controlling trap enabling, destinations, community authentication and
--   management station validation.  This group, more than any other, will
--   be deprecated as MIB data sets appear which handle higher level SNMP
--   admin requirements.

spSnmp		OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=	{ spiderII 4 }

-- spProtocols:
--
--   We include here any protocol data that is (in fact or potentially)
--   common to many Spider products; this can include protocol groups that
--   are being worked on by standards bodies, but which are far from
--   becoming accepted RFCs (the spExperimental' group is intended for
--   those groups that are firm, but as yet have no final resting place in
--   the Internet MIB.)
