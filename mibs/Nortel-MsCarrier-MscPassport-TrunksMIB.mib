-- Trunk/n
-- The Trunk component provides a Passport to Passport connection. It 
-- controls a protocol stack associated with a logical port on a function 
-- processor that provides an interconnection to another Passport with 
-- a Trunk component.
-- It requires the existence of the Routing component. Note that 
-- dpnRouting also needs to be included in the featureList of CP's 
-- LogicalProcessorType component.
-- Either an AtmAccess or an Unacknowledged subcomponent must be 
-- added to provide the underlying link protocol and associated 
-- hardware that the Trunk will use.

      The value powerOff indicates the resource requires power to be

      it can perform its normal functions, and this procedure has not been 
      initiated. The operationalState is disabled.

      as a multi-valued set, at most one value is shown to the user.
      
      When no values are in the set, this indicates that either the attribute 
      is not supported or that none of the status conditions described 
      below are present.
      
      The value underRepair indicates the component is currently being 
      repaired. The operationalState is enabled or disabled.
      
      The value critical indicates one or more critical alarms are 
      outstanding against the component. Other, less severe, alarms may 
      also be outstanding. The operationalState is enabled or disabled.
      
      The value major indicates one or more major alarms are 
      outstanding against the component. Other, less severe, alarms may 
      also be outstanding. The operationalState is enabled or disabled.
      
      The value minor indicates one or more minor alarms are 
      outstanding against the component. Other, less severe, alarms may 
      also be outstanding. The operationalState is enabled or disabled.
      
      The value alarmOutstanding generically indicates that an alarm of

      For a Trunk with a Unack subcomponent, and a DpnGateway with a

      transmit speed of the port; if a channelized port (E1/DS1) is used, 
      the value is the measured transmit speed of the Channel. 
      For a Trunk with an AtmAccess subcomponent, the value is 
      calculated by converting the VCC transmit cell rate to an equivalent 
      bit rate. The VCC transmit cell rate is determined based on the 
      vccReportingBw attribute of the Trunk AtmAccess component. If 
      vccReportingBw has a value of pcr and attribute bwElastic of 
      AtmAccess has a value of no, the peak cell rate (PCR) of the VCC, 
      defined in txTrafficDescParm of AtmIf Vcc Vcd, is used. If 
      vccReportingBw has a value of pcr and attribute bwElastic of 
      AtmAccess has a value of yes, the minimum of the PCR, defined in 
      txTrafficDescParm of AtmIf Vcc Vcd, and the current cell rate 
      (CCR) of the VCC is used. If vccReportingBw has a value of acr, 
      the best measurement of the actual cell rate (ACR) of the VCC is 
      used, which is the minimum of the PCR, the CCR and the actual 
      shaping rate (ASR).
      For a DpnGateway with a FrAccess subcomponent, the value 
      indicates the committedInformationRate of FrAccess FrMuxSetup.

      (1) the remote protocol is not compatible to the local protocol stack

      (2) the packet cannot be forwarded due to either a recent loss of 
      connectivity or due to congestion.
