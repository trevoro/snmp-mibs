-- Usage of this MIB module in conjunction with the Diffserv MIB.
--
--    Classifiers - this MIB defines two new classifier filter
--       element types:
--
--       - to compare the IEEE 802.1D user_priority value
--         from a packet. Classifier elements are each one of the
--         entries from dot1dQosUserPriTable and may be pointed to
--         by diffServClassifierFilter values.
--
--       - to compare the IEEE 802.1Q VLAN with which a packet is
--         associated. Note that this classification is considered
--         to take place on all packets that pass through this
--         particular element regardless of their incoming or outgoing
--         tagged/untagged status: i.e. the QoS classifier is considered
--         to take place "after" the IEEE 802.1Q VLAN ingress rules have
--         been applied. Therefore, the VLAN identifier implied is the
--         one which the Bridge MIB considers to be attached to each
--         packet. Such classifier filter elements are each one of the
--         entries from dot1dQosVlanClfrTable and may be pointed to by
--         diffServClassifierFilter values.
--
--    Meters - this MIB includes no new definitions or usage for Meters.
--
--    Actions - this MIB includes no new definitions for Actions.
--
--       A Marker action, to mark packets with an 802.1D user_priority
--       value, may be defined by creating a diffServActionEntry
--       which has a diffServActionSpecific pointing at one of the
--       entries in dot1dQosUserPriTable. Note that this remarking
--       action, which is considered to take place for all packets that
--       pass through this particular element regardless of their
--       incoming or outgoing tagged/untagges status, is not one that is
--       supported by the standard IEEE 802.1D model.
--
--       Note that remarking with a VLAN-ID is not considered to be a
--       QoS action - facilities for handling VLAN-ID tags in
--       accordance with IEEE 802.1Q are provided in the Bridge MIB
--       [BRIDGEMIB].
--
--    Queues, Algorithmic Droppers and Schedulers - this MIB includes no
--       new definitions or usage for these elements.

-- MIB Compliance statements.
