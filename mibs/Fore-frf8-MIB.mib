 --
 -- this table support the creation of a Frame Relay/ATM interworking
 -- connection.
 -- The frf8ConnTable supports the association of the Frame Relay
 -- connection with the internal ATM fabric connection.
 --
 -- To create a frame relay connection, the manager will request the
 -- agent to create a new row in this table, indexing it by dlci and
 -- serviceId and setting frf8ConnRowStatus to createAndWait.
 
 -- In response to this operation the agent will do the following
 -- (after checking the validity of the ifIndex and dlci values and
 -- making sure that a connection with these parameters does not yet
 -- exist):
 --  o  create a new entry in this table
 --  o  create an entry in frCircuitTable defined  in rfc1315.mib
 --  o  create an entry in frPVCEndptTable defined in rfc1604.mib
 --  o  create an entry in frextCircuitTable of fore-frs.mib
 --  o  define  the appropriate atm service identifier, vpi and vci
 --     for the internal (between the netmod and the switching
 --     fabric) ATM part of the interworked connection, and populate
 --     them in the appropriate objects of this entry.
 --
 -- After the mentioned entries in different tables have been created, the
 -- manager will populate other objects, in proprietary tables which
 -- are applicable to this connection (profile indexes, fabric vpi/vci,
 --  etc.) which will complete the Frame Relay/ATM connection
 -- definition. After that, changing frf8ConnRowStatus to active will
 -- cause the information  to be passed to  the netmod,
 -- so that the connection can be created in the netmod database.
 -- The connection will become operational after the setting of  AdminStatus
 -- to active.
