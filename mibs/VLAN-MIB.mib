--               lecStatusTable (pp 45-51 af-lane-0044-000, Sept 1995)
--               All of RFC 1573, except for statics counters.  For
--               example packet counts and octet counts are not required.
--            The relationship between the LEC MIB and RFC 1573 is
--               defined on pp 13 of af-lane-0044-000, Sept 1995.
--
-- Implementation issues:
--    This MIB controls 802 style VLANs and has very strict semantics with
--    regards to what happens when a row is created, when rows are
--    modified, etc.  Many of these actions have large side-effects, such
--    as dropping ports from VLANs, associating elans to 802 style VLANs,
--    etc.  Where entries have special meanings, an IMPORTANT tag has been
--    added to draw attention to specific semantics of this variable.
--    Additionally, implementation issues are spelled out here so that
--    all implementations of this MIB are consistent.

	DESCRIPTION
		"The textual name of this VLAN, this is the identifier
		that the user of a configuration utility will be using.
		Using a VLAN ID for the index and resolving to a name
		would be easier for an individual switch.  However, the user
		will not (and should not) use this ID.  The problem would
		then be how to resolve an ID to a Name, given that network
		manager needs to know this for all devices.  Using the name
		as the index allows a management application to have a list
		of names and each network device resolves that to a
		locally significant ID.  This means however, if the user
		configures, via a local interface, two switches with VLANs
		that have the same name, the network manager will assume
		that they are the same VLAN.

		In the future, when the 802.1Q standard comes out, there
		will be a standard way of maintaining globally unique VLAN
		IDs because these will be used as the VLAN tag.  At that
		time the index into this table should become the VLAN tag."

		they all resolve down to a group of ports.

		its value and the value of vlanType:

		part of any VLAN(s) that this port group is associated with.
		In addition, if the port is a virtual interface that
		represents a LEC, the ELAN that that LEC represents will
		also be part of the VLAN that this port group is associated

		 allowedNotAvail: This value is only needed for devices
			  that don't allow a port to be in more than one
