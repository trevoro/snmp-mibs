AlarmSeverity ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
        "The AlarmSeverity defines four severity levels,
        which provide an indication of how it is perceived that the
        capability of the managed object has been affected.  Those
        severity levels which represent service affecting conditions
        ordered from most severe to least severe are critical,
        major, minor and warning.  The levels used are a subset of
        the levels found in X.733, ITU Alarm Reporting Function:

            o The Indeterminate severity level indicates that the
              severity level cannot be determined.

            o The Critical severity level indicates that a service
              affecting condition has occurred and an immediate
              corrective action is required.  Such a severity can be
              reported, for example, when a managed object becomes
              totally out of service and its capability must be restored.

            o The Major severity level indicates that a service
              affecting condition has developed and an urgent corrective
              action is required.  Such a severity can be reported, for
              example, when there is a severe degradation in the
              capability of the managed object and its full capability
              must be restored.

            o The Warning severity level indicates the detection of a
              potential or impending service affecting fault, before any
              significant effects have been felt.  Action should be taken
              to further diagnose (if necessary) and correct the problem
              in order to prevent it from becoming a more serious service
              affecting fault.

        When an alarm is cleared, an alarmCleared event is generated.
        This event clears the alarm with the currentAlarmFaultId
        contained in the event.  It is not required that the clearing
        of previously reported alarms are reported.  Therefore, a managing
        system cannot assume that the absence of an alarmedCleared event
        for a fault means that the condition that caused the generation
        of previous alarms is still present.  Managed object definers
        shall state if, and under which conditions, the alarmedCleared
        event is used.

        The clear value of AlarmSeverity is an action which is used when
        a management station wants to clear an active alarm.  This is not
        possible on all systems, and thus an agent does not have support
        write access for this value."
