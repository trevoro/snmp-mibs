       tailDrop(2) or headDrop(3) represents an algorithm that is
       completely specified by this MIB.  A value of other(1) requires
       further specification in some other MIB module.

       The tailDrop(2) algorithm is described as follows:
       diffServAlgDropQThreshold represents the depth of the queue
       diffServAlgDropQMeasure at which all newly arriving packets will
       be dropped.

       The headDrop(3) algorithm is described as follows: if a packet
       arrives when the current depth of the queue
       diffServAlgDropQMeasure is at diffServAlgDropQThreshold, packets
       currently at the head of the queue are dropped to make room for
       the new packet to be enqueued at the tail of the queue.

       The randomDrop(4) algorithm is described as follows: on packet
       arrival, an algorithm is executed which may randomly drop the
       packet, or drop other packet(s) from the queue in its place. The
       specifics of the algorithm may be proprietary. For this
       algorithm, an associated diffServRandomDropEntry is indicated by
       pointing diffServAlgDropSpecific at the diffServRandomDropTable.
       The relevant entry in that table is selected by the common
       indexing of the two tables.  For this algorithm,
       diffServAlgQThreshold is understood to be the absolute maximum
       size of the queue and additional parameters are described in
