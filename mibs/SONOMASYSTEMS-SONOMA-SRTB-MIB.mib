             "Determines how this port behaves when presented
              with a Spanning Tree Explorer frame.  The value
              'disabled(2)' indicates that the port will not
               accept or send Spanning Tree Explorer packets; any
               STE packets received will be silently discarded.
               The value 'forced(3)' indicates the port will
               always accept and propagate Spanning Tree Explorer
               frames.  This allows a manually configured
               Spanning Tree for this class of packet to be
               configured.  Note that unlike transparent bridging
               this is not catastrophic to the network if there
               are loops.  The value 'auto-span(1)' can only be
               returned by a bridge that both implements the
               Spanning Tree Protocol and has use of the protocol
               enabled on this port. The behavior of the port for
               Spanning Tree Explorer frames is determined by the
               state of dot1dStpPortState.  If the port is in the
               'forwarding' state, the frame will be accepted or
               propagated.  Otherwise it will be silently
               discarded."
