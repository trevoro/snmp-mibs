       DESCRIPTION
         "The MIB module describing message tracking"
       ::= { msgTracking 1 }

-- Note that the MODULE-IDENTITY macro does not exist in SNMP version 1,
-- for a V1 implementation, replace the above macro with the following line :
--  mta-message-track OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {msgTracking 1 }


-- Note that the textual conventions DateAndTime and TimeInterval
-- do not exist in SNMPv1, for a V1 implementation include the following
-- 2 lines:
--   DateAndTime ::= DisplayString
--   TimeInterval ::= INTEGER (0..2147483647)
-- Define the NameForm textual convention for originator and recipient
-- names in this MIB
NameForm ::= INTEGER {
   freeForm(1),
   x400(2),
   smtp(3)
 }

-- Define the DispositionStatus textual convention which indicates the
-- disposition of a message by the MTA for a particular recipient.
-- Values are:
-- unknown   - The disposition of the message could not be determined
-- transferred - The message was forwarded to another MTA for
-- delivery without name or content transformation.
-- delivered - The message was delivered to the intended recipient.
-- non-delivered - The message could not be delivered to the intended 
-- recipient.
-- redirected - The message was forwarded to another MTA for
-- delivery.  The recipient name and/or messageId
-- may have changed as a result of this process.
-- dlist-expanded - The intended recipient was a distribution list
-- which was expanded by the MTA.
-- in-queue - The message for this recipient is currently being
-- processed by the MTA.

DispositionStatus ::= INTEGER {
   unknown(1),
   transferred(2),
   delivered(3),
   non-delivered(4),
   redirected(5),
   dlist-expanded(6),
   in-queue(7)
   }

-- Define the MsgType textual convention. Values are:
--
-- data
-- status
-- probe

MsgType ::= INTEGER {
  any(1),
  data(2),
  status(3),
  probe(4)
  }

-- How this mib works :
-- Most message tracking MIBs operate on the presupposition that the manager
-- entering a query knows the unique message ID for the message being tracked.
-- In practice, this is often not the case.  This MIB allows for a 2-step
-- query process - find the appropriate message, then track it.

--  STEP 1:
-- Using the index obtained from 'msgTrackNextRequestIndex', a manager
-- creates a conceptual row in the 'msgTrackRequestTable', filling in
-- as many message attributes as are known.  The manager also specifies
-- in 'reqMaxResponses', the maximim number of possible 'hits' for an
-- underspecified query.
--  STEP 2:
-- When the agent detects a new conceptual row in 'msgTrackRequestTable',
-- it forms a query to be executed against the message store(s).
--  STEP 3:
-- The agent issues the query against the message store and receives some
-- response(s).
--  STEP 4:
-- The agent then transfers up to 'reqMaxResponses' possible responses
-- to newly created conceptual rows in the 'msgTrackResponseTable'. The agent
-- then sets the value of 'reqResponseStatus' in the 'msgTrackRequestTable'
-- to notify the manager of the results of the query.
--  STEP 5:
-- The manager, having detected a change in 'reqResponseStatus', knows that
-- the query is complete.  It reads the potential responses from the
-- 'msgTrackResponseTable' and presents them to the end-user.
--  STEP 6:
-- The manager then instructs the agent to destroy the conceptual row
-- created in the 'msgTrackRequestTable', which causes the agent to
-- destroy the corresponding entries in the 'msgTrackResponseTable'.
--  STEP 7:  (optional, not illustrated)
-- If the original query did not produce an adequate response, a new entry
-- is created in the 'msgTrackRequestTable'.  Entries in this table are
-- never reused!
