                 "This object should be made equal to ifIndex.  The
                 next paragraph describes its previous usage.
                 Making the object equal to ifIndex allows proper
                 use of ifStackTable and ds0/ds0bundle mibs.

                 Previously, this object is the identifier of a DS1
                 Interface on a managed device.  If there is an
                 ifEntry that is directly associated with this and
                 only this DS1 interface, it should have the same
                 value as ifIndex.  Otherwise, number the
                 dsx1LineIndices with an unique identifier
                 following the rules of choosing a number that is
                 greater than ifNumber and numbering the inside
                 interfaces (e.g., equipment side) with even
                 numbers and outside interfaces (e.g, network side)
                 with odd numbers."
