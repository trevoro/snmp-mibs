      "Draft-ietf-pwe3-pw-mpls-mib-02 version. Changes from 
       previous version:
       1) Removing inbound table (no srict mode and no knowledge 
	      of inbound tunnel).
       2) Provisoning (i.e. RowCreate) done via mapping tables.
	      Outbound table is now read only for sorted search for
		  pwVcIndex.

   DESCRIPTION
      "Draft-ietf-pwe3-pw-mpls-mib-00 version. Changes from 
       previous version:
       1) Spliting the mapping table into two tables, one for
          Non TE application and one for TE application.
       2) Object types alignment with MPLS MIBs.

       1) Add LDP entity association.
       2) Clarify inbound/outbound directions.
       3) Simplify indexing of outbound and inbound tables

      "Changes from previous version:
       1) Remove Vc instance from table indexing.
       2) Update descriptions of indexing and protection.
       3) Remove the need for MPLS-LSR in case of VC only.
       4) Change pwVcMplsMplsType to BITS in order to enable
          multiple types of outer tunnel.
       5) Add ifindex to outer tunnel tables to support vcOnly 
          option.
       6) change naming of outbound, inbound and mapping tables to 
          reflect addition of VC only port ifindexes.
       7) Adapt order of items in mapping table to SNMP convention.

        In the case of VC only, it associate the VC with the 
        interface that shall carry the VC.
        This table is indexed by the pwVcIndex and an additional
        index enabling multiple rows for the same VC index.

        At least one entry is created in this table by the agent 
        for each PW VC that requires MPLS PSN. Note that the first
        entry for each VC can be indexed by pwVcMplsOutboundIndex 
        equal zero without a need for retrieval of 
        pwVcMplsOutboundIndexNext.

        This table points to the appropriate MPLS MIB. In the case 
        of MPLS-TE, the 4 variables relevant to the indexing of 
        a TE MPLS tunnel are set as in Srinivasan, et al, <draft-
        ietf-mpls-te-mib>.
        In case of Non-TE MPLS (an outer tunnel label assigned by 
        LDP or manually) the table points to the XC entry in the 
        LSR MIB as in Srinivasan, et al, <draft-ietf-mpls-lsr-mib>.
        In case of VC only (no outer tunnel) the ifIndex of the
        port to carry the VC is configured. 
        
        Each VC may have multiple rows in this tables if protection 
        is available at the outer tunnel level, each row may be of
        different type except for VC only, on which only rows with
        ifIndex of the port are allowed.
