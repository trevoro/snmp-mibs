    --  Announcement Table

    -- This table provides a mechanism for installing and viewing announcements 
    -- on the system by initiating a download request 
	 -- to a specific announcement entry (bin) in the  announcement 
    -- download table.  Prior to initiating the announcement request
	 -- a management entity must first set the following fields
	 -- in this table:
    --      salixAnnouncementFilename 
    --      salixAnnouncementIpAddress.
    --
    -- When the above fields are valid, the management entity
	 -- can then start the download by sending a request to the 
	 -- SNMP agent with the salixAnnouncementRequest field set to 
	 -- 'start' in addition to specifing values for the 
	 -- salixAnnouncementUsername and 
	 -- salixAnnouncementPassword fields.

    -- It is the responsibility of the management entity to poll the
    -- salixAnnouncementState to determine when the download completes.
    -- If the command completes with 'success', then the download to the
    -- was successful and the software is installed into the  
    -- system.

    -- The agent will create the salixAnnouncementTable with a fixed 
    -- number of entries when the host is booted.  The management entity
    -- can download to any entry in the salixAnnouncementTable with 
    -- the exception of entry (bin) zero.  Entry (bin) zero is reserved
    -- to indicate any empty software bin.

    -- A download request to an entry (bin) in the salixAnnouncementTable
    -- will overwrite the corresponding entry (bin) in the 
    -- salixAnnouncementTable.  However, a download request to an entry
    -- (bin) in the salixAnnouncementTable will be ignored if a previous
    -- request is still in progress.
