-- SMA Vlan Support MIB.
--
-- This module provides internal, private information to be shared
-- between units in the stack. A MIB definition is used to share this
-- information so that the existing SMA distributed SNMP stack can do 
-- most of the work.

        create a new entry in this table, it must obtain a non-zero index from 
        the a3ComNextAvailableVirtIfIndex object. Row creation in this table 
        will fail if the chosen index value does not match the current value 
        returned from the a3ComNextAvailableVirtIfIndex object."

        automatic (1) -
            This VLAN was created on this unit due to replication across
            a stack of units.
        dynamic (2) -
            VLAN created internally by some automatic mechanism, for
            example GVRP.
        manual (3) -
            VLAN created by some external management application.
        NOTE - This MIB object may only be set by the agent. It is illegal
        and serves no purpose for this object to be set for some other
