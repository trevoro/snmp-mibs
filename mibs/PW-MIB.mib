     DESCRIPTION 
         "This MIB contains managed object definitions for Pseudo 
          Wire operation as in: Pate, P., et al, <draft-ietf-pwe3- 
          framework>, Xiao, X., et al, <draft-ietf-pwe3- 
          requirements>, Martini, L., et al, <draft-martini- 
          l2circuit-trans-mpls>, and Martini, L., et al, 
          <draft-martini-l2circuit-encap-mpls>. 
   
          The indexes for this MIB are also used to index the PSN- 
          specific tables and the VC-specific tables. The VC Type 
          dictates which VC-specific MIB to use. For example, a  
          'cep' VC Type requires the use the configuration and status  
          tables within the CEP-MIB. 
   
          This MIB enable the use of any underlying packet switched  
          network (PSN). Specific tables for the MPLS PSN is 
          currently defined in a separate PW-MPLS-MIB. Tables to 
          support other PSNs (IP, L2TP for example) will be added to 
          this MIB in future revisions. 
           
          At the time of publication of this version, there are no  
          PWE3 WG documents for all features and objects in this MIB, 
          and the MIB is therefore subject to change based on the WG  
          progress."
