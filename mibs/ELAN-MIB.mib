                           is defined by the ELAN name, a set of
                           TLVs, and other parameters.  After an
                           ELAN is created, members of the ELAN

                           or Client (LEC) can be added to this
                           ELAN entry in their repective tables.
                           There are four memebers to an ELAN and
                           they are LECS, LES, BUS (Broadcast and
                           Unknown Server ) and LEC.  The support
                           of LECS is optional.  The addition and
                           deletion of LECS is done in the 
                           elanLecsConfGroup defined in this MIB.
                           The addition and deletion of the LEC

                           done in the LES MIB due to the fact that
                           LEC learns the BUS address only from
