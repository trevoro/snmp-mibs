      otherwise the component inherits the CID of its parent. The top-
      level component has a CID of 0.
      
      Every operator session also has a CID, which is the CID 
      provisioned for the operator's user ID. An operator will see only the 
      stream data for components having a matching CID. Also, the 
      operator will be allowed to issue commands for only those 
      components which have a matching CID.
      
      An operator CID of 0 is used to identify the Network Manager 
      (referred to as 'NetMan' in DPN). This CID matches the CID of 
      any component. Values 1 to 8191 inclusive (equivalent to 'basic 
      CIDs' in DPN) may be assigned to specific customers."

      defined as a multi-valued set, at most one value is shown to the user.
      
      When no values are in the set, this indicates that either the attribute 
      is not supported or that none of the status conditions described 
      below are present.
      
      The value inTest indicates that the resource is undergoing a test 
      procedure. If adminState is locked or shuttingDown, the normal 
      users are precluded from using the resource and controlStatus is 
      reservedForTest. Tests that do not exclude additional users can be 
      present in any operational or administrative state but the 
      reservedForTest condition should not be present.
      
      The value failed indicates that the component has an internal fault 
      that prevents it from operating. The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value dependency indicates that the component cannot operate 
      because some other resource on which it depends is unavailable. 
      The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value powerOff indicates the resource requires power to be 
      applied and it is not powered on. The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value offLine indicates the resource requires a routine 
      operation (either manual, automatic, or both) to be performed to 
      place it on-line and make it available for use. The operationalState 
      is disabled.
      
      The value offDuty indicates the resource is inactive in accordance 
      with a predetermined time schedule. In the absence of other 
      disabling conditions, the operationalState is enabled or disabled.
      
      The value degraded indicates the service provided by the 
      component is degraded in some way, such as in speed or operating 
      capacity. However, the resource remains available for service. The 
      operationalState is enabled.

      The value initializationRequired indicates (for a resource which 
      doesn't initialize autonomously) that initialization is required before 
      it can perform its normal functions, and this procedure has not been 
      initiated. The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value notInitialized indicates (for a resource which does

      defined as a permanentMaster. The connection cannot be 
      established if the remote end is defined as anything else. The

      The permanentSlaveWithBackup attempts to call once per minute. 
      When type is set to permanentSlaveWithBackup, the connection is 
      cleared if the interface becomes unavailable. This enables a retry of 
      the connection which can be redirected to the 
      permanentBackupSlave.
      
      If the value is set to permanentBackupSlave then a permanent 
      connection is established between the two ends only if the 
      permanentMaster end is disconnected from the 
      permanentSlaveWithBackup end and a backup call is established 
      by the call redirection system. If the permanentSlaveWithBackup 
      interface becomes available again, the permanentBackupSlave end 
      is disconnected and the permanentSlaveWithBackup end is 
      reconnected to the permanentMaster end. The 
      permanentBackupSlave end does not try to establish a call.
      
      If the value is set to spvcMaster, then a permanent connection is 
      established between two ends, with resiliency at the NNI), if the 
      connection transits across two or more networks. The remote end, 
      which may be in the same network, or an external network that is 
      reachable via Frame Relay NNIs, must be defined as either a 
      spvcSlave, spvcBackupSlave or spvcSlaveWithBackup. The 
      connection cannot be established if the remote end is defined as 
      anything else. The end defined as spvcMaster always initiates the 
      call. It attempts to call once per minute. The call is attempted by the 
      spvcMaster and accepted by the remote end only if all of the 
      following conditions are satisfied, at both ends:
      1. The physical layer must be operational.
      2. The LMI procedures must be in normalCondition (that is, no 
      service affecting condition).
      3. If the LMI side attribute is provisioned to both, the A-bit 
      received from the interface must be Active. If the LMI side 
      attribute is not provisioned to both, this condition does not 
      apply.
      
      After a call is cleared, the spvcMaster end attempts to retry the call 
      according to the rule for the clear cause. If the call is cleared or 
      rejected due to the failure of one of the three conditions indicated 
      above, or due to unavailability of resources along any point in the 
      connection path, the call will be retried after 60 seconds. For all 
      other causes, such as loss of service at an NNI, the call will be 
      retried immediately.
      
      If the value is set to spvcSlave then an SPVC connection is 
      established between two ends. The remote end must be defined as 
      an spvcMaster. The connection cannot be established if the remote 
      end is defined as anything else. The spvcSlave end does not attempt 
      to call.
      
      If the value is set to spvcSlaveWithBackup then a SPVC connection 
      is established between the two ends. The remote end must be 
      defined as an spvcMaster. The connection cannot be established if 
      the remote interface end is defined as anything else. Unlike a 
      permanentSlaveWithBackup end, the spvcSlaveWithBackup end 
      does not attempt to call. If the value is set to spvcSlaveWithBackup, 
      the connection is cleared if the interface becomes unavailable. This 
      enables a retry of the connection by the spvcMaster end, which may 
      be redirected to an end that is set to spvcBackupSlave.
      
      If the value is set to spvcBackupSlave then an SPVC connection is 
      established between the two ends only if the spvcMaster end is 
      disconnected from the spvcSlaveWithBackup end, and a backup 
      call is redirected by the call redirection system. Unlike the PVC 
      connection, if the spvcSlaveWithBackup interface becomes 
      available again, the spvcBackupSlave end is not disconnected and 
      the spvcSlaveWithBackup end is not reconnected to the spvcMaster 
      end. Neither the spvcBackupSlave nor the spvcSlaveWithBackup 
      ends try to establish an SPVC call."

      The transfer priority is a preference configured for an application

      Each transfer priority n, where n is the transfer priority index, has a 
      default setting for routing class of service (multimedia, delay, or 
      throughput) and Frame Relay egress queue (depending on the 
      number of supported egress queues on the remote end interface).
      These settings are specified by the routingClassOfService and

      The purpose of Vc attributes is to aid end users and verification

      useful when the network has experienced abnormality and we want 
      to isolate problems and pinpoint trouble spots. 
      Attributes are collected on a per Vc basis. Until a need is identified, 
      statistics are not collected at a processor level. Each attribute is 
      stored in a 32 bit field and is initialized to zero when a Vc enters 
      into the data transfer state. When a PVC is disconnected and then 
      connected again, the attributes will be reset. Attributes cannot be 
      reset through other methods. 
      Frame Relay Vc uses a best effort data packet delivery protocol and 
      a different packet segmentation and combination methods from the 
      General Vc. The Frame Relay Vc uses the same call setup and 
      control mechanism (e.g. the support of non-flow control data 
      packets) as in a General Vc. Most General Vc statistics and internal 
      variables are used in a Frame Relay Vc and are displayed by

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute specifies whether rate adaptation is in effect for this 
      user Data Link Connection on this Frame Relay interface. Rate 
      adaptation is a feature that, in periods of congestion, adapts the rate 
      at which the user is allowed to send data into the network to that 
      which the network is able to handle at that time. This pro-active 
      measure of handling congestion optimizes network resources by 
      causing the ingress to discard frames that would otherwise be 
      discarded in the network.
      
      If this attribute is set to on, then, at the onset of congestion, the 
      excess information rate (EIR) is reduced to a very low rate. If 
      congestion persists, then the allowed CIR is reduced geometrically 
      by 25% of the current value at that time. The minimum to which 
      CIR can be reduced is 1/16th (6.25%) of the provisioned value. As 
      congestion alleviates, CIR is increased linearly by 6.25% of the 
      provisioned value specified in committedInformationRate.
      
      If set to eirOnly, then rate adaptation will only apply to the excess 
      information rate (EIR). At the onset of congestion, the allowed EIR 
      is reduced by 25% of its provisioned value. If congestion persists, 
      EIR is reduced geometrically by 25% of the current value at that 
      time. As congestion alleviates, EIR is gradually increased linearly 
      by 6.25% of the provisioned EIR.
      
      If set to cirProportionate, then rate adaptation will also only apply 
      to the excess information rate (EIR). At the onset of congestion the 
      initial allowed EIR is set to a multiple of the provisioned CIR. If 
      congestion persists, the allowed EIR is reduced geometrically by 
      25% of the current value at that time. As congestion alleviates, EIR 
      is gradually increased linearly by 6.25% of the provisioned EIR. 
      Note that the allowed EIR may be set higher than the provisioned 
      EIR, since it is calculated initially using another parameter, the 
      provisioned CIR. If the allowed EIR at the moment is higher than 
      the provisioned EIR, then the provisioned EIR is used instead.
      
      This attribute can only be set to on eirOnly or cirProportionate if

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute specifies the sensitivity of the rate adaptation system. 
      A higher number indicates a higher sensitivity and therefore a

      time allows the network to discard frames at the access and protect 
      network resources, but can lead to false alarms and a greater 
      fluctuation of the allowed rate. A higher setting therefore tends to 
      favour the protection of the network over the allowed throughput of 
      the user.
      
      A lower number indicates a lower sensitivity and therefore a slower 
      reaction to network conditions. A slower reaction time results in a 
      greater amount of user traffic allowed into the network, but can lead 
      to a waste of network bandwidth since the traffic may be discarded 
      at the congested resource. A lower setting therefore tends to favour 
      the allowed throughput of the user over the protection of the 
      network.
      
      This attribute is applicable for adapting EIR when rateAdaptation is 
      eirOnly or cirProportionate, or CIR when rateAdaptation is on.

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute specifies whether closed-loop rate adaptation is in 
      effect for SVCs on this interface. Rate adaptation is a feature that, in 
      periods of congestion, adapts the rate at which the user is allowed to 
      send data into the network to that which the network is able to 
      handle at that time. This proactive measure of handling congestion 
      optimizes network resources by causing the ingress to discard 
      frames that would otherwise be discarded in the network.
      
      If this attribute is set to on, then, at the onset of congestion, the 
      excess information rate (EIR) is reduced to a very low rate. If 
      congestion persists, then the allowed CIR is reduced geometrically 
      by 25% of the current value at that time. The minimum to which 
      CIR can be reduced is 1/16th (6.25%) of the provisioned value. As 
      congestion alleviates, CIR is increased linearly by 6.25% of the 
      provisioned value specified in committedInformationRate.
      
      If set to eirOnly, then rate adaptation will only apply to the excess 
      information rate (EIR). At the onset of congestion, the allowed EIR 
      is reduced by 25% of its provisioned value. If congestion persists, 
      EIR is reduced geometrically by 25% of the current value at that 
      time. As congestion alleviates, EIR is gradually increased linearly 
      by 6.25% of the provisioned EIR.
      
      If set to cirProportionate, then rate adaptation will also only apply 
      to the excess information rate (EIR). At the onset of congestion the 
      initial allowed EIR is set to a multiple of the provisioned CIR. If 
      congestion persists, the allowed EIR is reduced geometrically by 
      25% of the current value at that time. As congestion alleviates, EIR 
      is gradually increased linearly by 6.25% of the provisioned EIR. 
      Note that the allowed EIR may be set higher than the provisioned 
      EIR, since it is calculated initially using another parameter, the 
      provisioned CIR. If the allowed EIR at the moment is higher than 
      the provisioned EIR, then the provisioned EIR is used instead.
      
      This attribute can only be set to on or eirOnly if rateEnforcement is 
      set to on."

      A higher number indicates a higher sensitivity and therefore a

      time allows the network to discard frames at the access and protect 
      network resources, but can lead to false alarms and a greater 
      fluctuation of the allowed rate. A higher setting therefore tends to 
      favor the protection of the network over the allowed throughput of 
      the user.
      
      A lower number indicates a lower sensitivity and therefore a slower 
      reaction to network conditions. A slower reaction time results in a 
      greater amount of user traffic allowed into the network, but can lead 
      to a waste of network bandwidth since the traffic may be discarded 
      at the congested resource. A lower setting therefore tends to favour 
      the allowed throughput of the user over the protection of the 
      network.

      This algorithm generates bursts of burstSize frames separated by 10 
      ms delays.

      This aglorithm is similar to IntervalBurst, except a fixed burst size 
      of 12 frames is used.
      
      delayMeasurement
      This algorithm is used to measure delay. The specified number of
