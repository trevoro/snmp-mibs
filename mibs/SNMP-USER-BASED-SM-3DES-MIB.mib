-- A.  SNMP engine Installation Parameters Using 3DES-EDE
-- 
--    In order to use the 3DES-EDE privacy protocol in place of the CBC-
--    DES, the SNMP engine may use the following usmUserEntry in the
--    initial configuration of the usmUserTable:
--                                  privacy support
--                                  --------------

-- B.1.  Password-to-Key Chaining Sample Results using MD5
-- 
--    [Please Note: This note will be removed when the following values
--    have been double-checked by a third party.]
-- 
--    The following shows a sample output of the password-to-key algorithm
--    for a 32-octet key using MD5.  The password used in this example is
--    "maplesyrup".  The first 16 octets (bytes 1 through 16) are generated
--    by password-to-key algorithm with the pasphrase as input.  The second
--    16 octets (bytes 17 through 32) are generated from the password-to-
--    key algorithm with the first 16 octets as input.
-- 
--    Each invocation of the password-to-key algorithm in the generation of
--    a string of key bits uses the same engineID.  In this example the
--    engineID is:
-- 
--       '00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 02'H
-- 
--    The final output of the password-to-key algorithm, used twice as
--    described above, produces a 32-octet localized key of:
--       '52 6f 5e ed 9f cc e2 6f 89 64 c2 93 07 87 d8 2b
--        79 ef f4 4a 90 65 0e e0 a3 a4 0a bf ac 5a cc 12'H
-- 
-- B.2.  Password-to-Key Chaining Sample Results using SHA
-- 
--    [Please Note: This note will be removed when the following values
--    have been double-checked by a third party.]
-- 
--    The following shows a sample output of the password-to-key algorithm
--    for a 40-octet key using SHA.  The password used in this example is
--    "maplesyrup".  The first 20 octets (bytes 1 through 20) are generated
--    by password-to-key algorithm with the pasphrase as input.  The second
--    20 octets (bytes 21 through 40) are generated from the password-to-
--    key algorithm with the first 20 octets as input.
-- 
--    Each invocation of the password-to-key algorithm in the generation of
--    a string of key bits uses the same engineID.  In this example the
--    engineID is:
-- 
--       '00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 02'H
-- 
--    The final output of the password-to-key algorithm, used twice as
--    described above, produces a 40-octet localized key of:
-- 
--       '66 95 fe bc 92 88 e3 62 82 23 5f c7 15 1f 12 84 97 b3 8f 3f

--    Let us assume that a user has a current password of "maplesyrup" as

-- 
--       '00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 02'H
-- 
--    If we now want to change the password to "newsyrup", then we first
--    calculate the localized key for the new password.  It is as follows:
-- 
--        87 02 1d 7b d9 d1 01 ba 05 ea 6e 3b f9 d9 bd 4a
--        70 29 8b 75 7c 91 99 b6 a8 fb f3 93 7b e0 54 XX'H

--    we compute a keyChange value of:

-- 
--    If we now want to change the password to "newsyrup", then we first

-- D.1.  Strength of 3DES-EDE and Known Attacks
-- 
--    Although 3DES-EDE has an effective key length of 168 bits (56 * 3),
--    it may be attacked with brute force as though its key were only 112
--    bits via the meet-in-the-middle attack [MULTI-CRYPT].  Even so, this
--    number of key bits is greater than the minimum currently recommended
--    by expert cryptanalysts, although it is still somewhat short of the
--    most conservative estimates [MIN-KEYLENGTH].
-- 
--    It has been demonstrated that a DES key may be recovered by
--    differential cryptanalysis [DIFF-ANALYSIS] and linear cryptanalysis
--    [LIN-ANALYSIS] after collecting a minimum of 2^47 and 2^43
--    plaintext/ciphertext pairs, respectively.  3DES-EDE is susceptible to
--    the same attacks given the same number of plaintext/ciphertext pairs
--    [DESMODES].
-- 
--    Thus the primary value of 3DES-EDE over DES is not so much that it is
--    more resistant to published theoretical attacks, but that it is
--    apparently more resistant to brute force attacks.
-- 
--    [DIFF-ANALYSIS] also demonstrates a rare attack which requires only
--    2^33 plaintext/ciphertext pairs.  For this reason, it is recommended
--    that keys are changed after no more than 2^32 block encryptions.
-- 
--    Finally, as has been demonstrated in the context of IP Security, it
--    is often a simpler and highly successful technique to guess at the
--    contents of an encrypted block, and use these guesses in combination
--    with differential or linear cryptananalysis to increase the
--    probability of recovering the secret key [PLAIN-ANALYSIS].  SNMP has
--    possible vulnerabilities in this regard as the following PDU fields
--    are likely to be easily predictable by a passive observer:
-- 
--       - PDU Type
--       - Request ID
--       - Error Status, Error Index
--       - Non-Repeaters, Max-Repetition
-- 
--    Implementations may be classified by the species of their ASN.1
--    encoding engines, just as network hosts and routers may be classified
--    by the species of their TCP/IP stack.  This in combination with
--    knowledge of common PDU exchanges makes the prediction of PDU fields
--    a realistic endeavor.
-- 
--    Suggestions in [PLAIN-ANALYSIS] for closing these sorts of security
--    holes include:
--       * Starting counters at random values,
--       * Replacing predictable values with random values when they are
--           already known by the receiver,
--       * Keyed compression.
-- 
--    Concerns of this nature, however, are beyond the scope of this
--    document.
