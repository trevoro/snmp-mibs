    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
       "Metric Name:
          Type-P-APM-Availability

        Metric Definition:
          This metric characterizes the availability of a
          network service by measuring the percentage of
          successful transactions the network service
          delivers over a given time interval.

          This metric is calculated by first measuring
          the IPPM metric
          'Type-P-Interval-Bidirectional-Connectivity'
          for the interval starting at the instant 'Src'
          initiates a transaction of Type-P with the 'Dst'
          host, and ending at the instant the last packet
          of the transaction has been received. In addition to
          successful connectivity over this interval, the
          particular application request must also succeed,
          for a transaction to be considered successful.
          If either condition is false, then that transaction
          is considered to be unsuccessful.

          The derived metric is defined as the total number
          of successful transactions between Src and Dst,
          divided by the total number of transaction attempts
          between Src and Dst, during the time interval dT.

        Metric Parameters:
          Src, the network address of a host
          Dst, the network address of a host
          dT, a time interval

        Metric Units:
          Percentage

        Mapping of Type P:
          Type P refers to an application protocol
          encapsulation, identified by a specific
          protocolDirEntry.

-- APM Responsiveness Metric for Transaction-oriented applications

    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
       "Metric Name:
          Type-P-APM-Transaction-Responsiveness

        Metric Definition:
          This metric characterizes the speed at which a
          transaction-oriented network application delivers
          a requested service, by measuring the speed of
          individual application transactions.

          This metric is calculated by utilizing a variation of
          the IPPM metric 'Type-P-Round-trip-Delay'. The
          total transaction time (dT) is determined by summing
          all the packet transactions of Type-P between the
          Src and Dst hosts. The bi-directional flight times
          are measured (as specified by the IPPM metric definition),
          but the server response time for each request is included
          in the measurement.

          The derived metric is defined as the total number
          of tenths of seconds for the transaction between
          Src and Dst to complete.

        Metric Parameters:
          Src, the network address of a host
          Dst, the network address of a host
          dT, a time interval

        Metric Units:
          Tenths of seconds

        Mapping of Type P:
          Type P refers to an application protocol
          encapsulation, identified by a specific
          protocolDirEntry, which is characterized
          as a transaction-oriented protocol.

    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
       "Metric Name:
          Type-P-APM-Throughput-Responsiveness

        Metric Definition:
          This metric characterizes the speed at which a
          throughput-oriented network application delivers
          a requested service, by measuring the transfer rate
          of individual application transactions.

          This metric is calculated by ... [rest of para is TBD]

          The derived metric is normalized and inverted, into
          units of 'seconds per terabit'. For transactions
          up to one terabit in size, it is defined as the
          total number of seconds it would take for the
          transaction between Src and Dst to complete, if
          the transaction size included one terabit of data.
          For transactions over one terabit in size, it
          is defined as the average number of seconds for the
          transaction between Src and Dst to complete, for
          each terabit of data.

          E.g., a transfer rate of 2Kbps equals 500,000,000 and
          a transfer rate of 1Gbps = 1000.

        Metric Parameters:
          Src, the network address of a host
          Dst, the network address of a host
          dT, a time interval
          B, a number of terabits

        Metric Units:
          Seconds Per Terabit

        Mapping of Type P:
          Type P refers to an application protocol
          encapsulation, identified by a specific
          protocolDirEntry, which is characterized
          as a throughput-oriented protocol.
