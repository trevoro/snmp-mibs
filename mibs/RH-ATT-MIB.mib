-- The first implementation is found on	the
-- SmartHUB XE ROM version 1.0 and Flash version 1.0
-- 

-->1.0	MIB II
-- These objects are from RFC1213, MIB II the descriptions
-- are expanded	to indicate how	the standard objects are
-- interpreted for the SmartHUB	XE

-- sysDescr  OBJECT-TYPE
-- SYNTAX	DisplayString
-- ACCESS	read-only
-- STATUS	mandatory
-- DESCRIPTION
-- A textual description of the entity. This value	should
-- include	the full name and version identification of the
-- system's hardware type,	software operating-system, and
-- networking software. It	is mandatory that this only contain
-- printable ASCII	characters.
-- 
-- An SmartHUB XE responds	with the string:

-- ::= { system 4 }
-- 
-- 
-- sysName	OBJECT-TYPE

-- ::= { system 5 }
-- 
-- 
-- sysLocation OBJECT-TYPE
-- SYNTAX	DisplayString

-- 
-- 
-- sysServices OBJECT-TYPE
-- SYNTAX	INTEGER
-- ACCESS	read-only
-- STATUS	mandatory
-- DESCRIPTION
-- 
-- Value =	1 = 2^(1-1)
-- 
-- A value	which indicates	the set	of services that this entity
-- primarily offers.
-- 
-- The value is a sum.  This sum initially	takes the value
-- zero, Then, for	each layer, L, in the range 1 through 7,
-- that this node performs	transactions for, 2 raised to (L -
-- 1) is added to the sum.	 For example, a	node which performs
-- primarily routing functions would have a value of 4 (2^(3-
-- 1)).  In contrast, a node which	is a host offering
-- application services would have	a value	of 72 (2^(4-1) +
-- 2^(7-1)).  Note	that in	the context of the Internet suite of
-- protocols, values should be calculated accordingly:
-- 
-- layer  functionality
--    1  physical (e.g., repeaters)
--    2  datalink/subnetwork (e.g., bridges)
--    3  internet (e.g., IP gateways)
--    4  end-to-end  (e.g., IP hosts)
--    7  applications (e.g., mail relays)
-- 
-- For systems including OSI protocols, layers 5 and 6 may	also
-- be counted.

-- DESCRIPTION
-- Indicates whether the SNMP agent process is permitted to
-- generate authentication-failure	traps.	The value of this
-- object overrides any configuration information;	as such, it
-- provides a means whereby all authentication-failure traps
-- may be disabled.
-- 
-- This object disables the enterprise specific password trap.
-- 
-- This object remains constant between re-initializations	of
-- the network management system.

Card Failure Map
For each test in the Test Result map, there is are two
corresponding octects in the card failure map.	The octects
are positionally encoded to represent the cards	in the rack,
if a bit is set	(1) it indicates which card failed that	test
(more than one bit may be set).	 Bit 0 is the Bus Logic	Unit
(slot 0), and	bits 1 to 15 are cards 1 to 15 respectively
(note the SmartHUB XE only supports 7 cards at this time)

Diagnostic Register Results
All boards also	support	a diagnostic register which contains
a code corresponding to	the current health of that board.
(This is especially useful for non-MPR boards which don't
report other diagnostics through this MIB)
