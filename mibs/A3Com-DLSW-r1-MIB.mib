    DESCRIPTION
       "This table is the circuit representation in the DLSw
        entity. Virtual data links are used to represent any internal
        end stations.  There is a conceptual row associated with
        each data link.  Thus, for circuits without an intervening
        transport connection, there are two conceptual rows
        for each circuit.
 
        The table consists of the circuits being established,
        established, and as an implementation option, circuits that
        have been disconnected.  For circuits carried over
        transport connections, an entry is created after
        the CUR_cs was sent or received.  For circuits between
        two locally attached devices, or internal virtual MAC
        addresses, an entry is created when the equivalent of
        CUR_cs sent/received status is reached.
 
        End station 1 (S1) and End station 2 (S2) are used to
        represent the two end stations of the circuit.
        S1 is always an end station which is locally attached.
        S2 may be locally attached or remote.  If it is locally
        attached, the circuit will be represented by two rows indexed
        by (A, B) and (B, A) where A & B are the relevant MACs/SAPs.
 
        The table may be used to store the causes of disconnection of
        circuits.  It is recommended that the oldest disconnected
        circuit entry be removed from this table when the memory
        space of disconnected circuits is needed."
