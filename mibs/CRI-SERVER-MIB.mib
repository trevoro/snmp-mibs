				boards. DR detach operation also assigns
				memory addresses. The method used to ensure
				unique addresses is to assign addresses
				based on slot number. To allow for 2 way
				inter-board interleaving, these addresses
				are slot number*8G.

				The map is a 16-byte array representing the 16
				slots. The lower 7 bits of each byte
				represents the unique address assign to that
				slot. The high bit is significant on a
				write-operation only, when set the
				corresponding slot of the map will be changed
				with the address represented by the lower
				7 bits. On a read operation the returning data
				represents the current memory map and the high
				bit of each byte is always 0. On a write
				operation the byte with the high bit set will
				be modified.

				The SNMP agent will perform a consistency check
				before committing a write operation.
				Consistency check simply makes sure no two slots
				will contain the same address if the write is
				performed. If consistency check fails, the write
				operation will return an error.
