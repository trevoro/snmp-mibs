	-- NOTE:
	-- This MIB, especially in the configuration tables, refers to
	-- "local" and "remote" devices. These terms are used to identify
	-- devices relative to the interface that is being managed. The
	-- "local" device is the Frame Relay equipment connected to the
	-- interface (port) being managed. The "remote" device refers to
	-- the Frame Relay equipment connected to the interface that will
	-- be at the other end of the call or calls associated with the
	-- PVCs being managed.
	-- 
	-- Also, this MIB refers to originating and terminating endpoints.
	-- These terms are used to identify which DLCI initiates the call.
	-- It does not refer to the device that sends or receives data,
	-- that is independent of the call setup. The originating endpoints
	-- initiate the call, the terminating endpoint only acknowledges,
	-- receives, and completes the call setup process.
