                      "The table contained in the local database which
                      defines local MIB views.  Each SNMP party has a
                      single MIB view which is defined by two
                      collections of view subtrees: the included view
                      subtrees, and the excluded view subtrees.  Every
                      such subtree, both included and excluded, is
                      defined in this table.

                      To determine if a particular object instance is in
                      a particular SNMP party's MIB view, compare the
                      object instance's Object Identifier with each
                      entry (for this party) in this table.  If none
                      match, then the object instance is not in the MIB
                      view.  If one or more match, then the object
                      instance is included in, or excluded from, the MIB
                      view according to the value of viewStatus in the
                      entry whose value of viewSubtree has the most
                      sub-identifiers.  If multiple entries match and
                      have the same number of sub-identifiers, then the
                      lexicographically greatest instance of viewStatus
                      determines the inclusion or exclusion.

                      An object instance's Object Identifier X matches
                      an entry in this table when the number of sub-
                      identifiers in X is at least as many as in the
                      value of viewSubtree for the entry, and each sub-
                      identifier in the value of viewSubtree matches its
                      corresponding sub-identifier in X.  Two sub-
                      identifiers match either if the corresponding bit
                      of viewMask is zero (the 'wild card' value), or if
                      they are equal.

                      Due to this 'wild card' capability, we introduce
                      the term, a 'family' of view subtrees, to refer to
                      the set of subtrees defined by a particular
                      combination of values of viewSubtree and viewMask.
                      In the case where no 'wild card' is defined in
                      viewMask, the family of view subtrees reduces to a
                      single view subtree."

                      Each bit of this bit mask corresponds to a sub-

                      If the value of this bit mask is M bits long and
