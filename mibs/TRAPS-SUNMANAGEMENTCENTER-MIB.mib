-- This MIB was created by extracting information from 
-- Sun Mangement Center 3.5 for use in other applications
-- to help determine what is actually listed in the SMC snmp 
-- agent. Sun has/will not release their MIBS for this 
-- information, so I created them from all information that
-- they have released.
--
-- Most all the information should be correct, but
-- if you find a discrepency please let me know. I do not
-- have all available Sun hardware to test with, so not 
-- not all types of support hardware has been tested.
-- These MIBs have only been tested using the utilities
-- from net-snmp. They may or may not work with other
-- applications.
-- 
-- The MIBs are not detailed, they only are useful in 
-- mapping OIDs to names. At some point in time 
-- descriptions may be given.
