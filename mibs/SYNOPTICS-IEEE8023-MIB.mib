		"This variable causes the MAC sublayer to enter the normal

		It is accomplished by setting receiveEnabled and
		transmitEnabled to true. Setting this variable to enabled(1) 
		enables the MAC sublayer to both receive and transmit frames. 
		Setting this variable to enabled(1) will also set the 
		ieee8023TransmitStatus variable to enabled(1). Similarly, 
		setting this variable to disabled(2) will also set 
		ieee8023TransmitStatus to disabled(2). Modifying this variable 
		does not change the state of any other variables. If the 
		variable is set to disabled(2), then any current 
		transmission/reception is completed before the 
		transmission/reception process is disabled. The value 
		returned when this variable is read is the logical and of the 
		receiveEnabled and transmitEnabled MAC internal	state 
		variables. If both are in the enabled state, then enabled(1) 
		is returned; otherwise disabled(2) is returned."
