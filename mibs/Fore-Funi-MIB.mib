-- This mib contains two tables:
-- (1) funiConnTable
-- (2) funiIfExtTable

-- funiConnTable allows to initiate creation of a FUNI connection
-- as well as to retrieve internal interworking mapping to the
-- internal atm connection, i.e. to find out on which service,
-- vpi, vci the data associated with this connection gets to the
-- switching fabric. Later on, the service can be converted to the
-- BNP notation by means of ifIndexMapTable from fore-switch MIB.
--
-- To create a FUNI PVC connection, the manager will request the agent
-- to create a new row in this table, indexing it by serviceIfIndex, 
-- funiVpi and funiVci, and setting funiConnRowStatus to
-- createAndWait.
--
-- In response to this operation, the agent will do the following
-- (after checking the validity of the ServiceIfIndex and Vpi, Vci
-- values and making sure that a connection with these parameters
-- does not yet exist):
--  o  create a new entry in this table;
--  o  create an entry in funiVclStatsTable defined in standard 
--     FUNI MIB, i.e., funi.mib;
--  o  define  the appropriate ATM sevice identifier, vpi and vci
--     for the internal (between the netmod and the switching
--     fabric) ATM part of the interworked connection, and populate
--     them in the appropriate objects of this entry.
--
-- After the mentioned entries in different tables are created, the
-- manager will populate other objects, in proprietory tables which
-- are applicable to this connection (profile indices, output port,
-- VPI, VCI, etc.) which will complete the FUNI/ATM connection
-- definition. After that, changing funiConnRowStatus to
-- active will cause the information to be passed down to the netmod,
-- so that the connection will be created in the netmod database.
-- Also, the connection (actually it's first hop, which is between the
-- WAN and ATM interfaces on the netmod) to become operational.
-- setting funiConnRowStatus to destroy will trigger the deletion
-- process for this connection.
--
--Note: ATM MIB mentioned in this MIB refers to the one defined in
--rfc1695.txt.
