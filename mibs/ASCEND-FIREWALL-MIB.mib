-- Firewall Control Protocol group.  This group of variables allows
-- external entities to dynamically alter Ascend Secure Access firewalls
-- by allowing them to request the creation and destruction of "dynamic
-- rules".  Each dynamic rule has a name as well as a set of standard
-- parameters that control the behavior of the rule.
--
-- sysFcpExecute is a "trigger" for the Fcp group.  Any number of requests
-- may be used to prepare the other variables in the group; when the 
-- management station is satisfied that all the variables are set, it
-- can trigger the firewall action by SETting the sysFcpExecute variable
-- to either "enb-rule" to cause a dynamic rule to be created, or "dis-rule"
-- to cause an existing dynamic rule to be disabled.
--
-- The parameters and trigger should all be set in the same SNMP packet,
-- in case multiple management stations are using FCP.

    fwallCtrlRuleName	OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX		DisplayString
	ACCESS		read-write
	STATUS		mandatory
	DESCRIPTION	"The name of the firewall rule to be enabled or
			disabled.  This name corresponds with a name
			established when the firewall was created (as
			by the Secure Access Manager).  There is no
			valid default value."

	SYNTAX		INTEGER {
			    no-op( 1 ),
			    enb-rule( 2 ),
			    dis-rule( 3 )
			}
	ACCESS		read-write
	STATUS		mandatory
	DESCRIPTION	"Cause a firewall given by the above
			parameters to be affected as requested.
			enb-rule causes a dynamic rule to be created;
			dis-rule causes a dynamic rule to cease operating.
			Default to 1 (no-op)."

    fwallCtrlTimeOut	OBJECT-TYPE
	SYNTAX		INTEGER (0..2147483647)
	ACCESS		read-write
	STATUS		mandatory
	DESCRIPTION	"Time, expressed in seconds, during which this
			firewall rule will effect the firewall.  After
			the expiration time, the rule will cease being
			effective exactly as if a del-rule (see
			fwallCtrlExecute above) had been executed on it.
			Default is defined in the firewall as defined
			by the firewall designer, and if none is
			given in the firewall, it is 3600 seconds."

	DESCRIPTION	"Address of entity outside firewall.  This
			value defaults to 0.0.0.0, equivalent to
			a don't care.  May be used when selecting
			firewall to be updated (see fwallCtrlRoutAddr).
			The default value of zero could match any
			real IP address if ExtAddrMask is zero,
			otherwise it would match NO IP address."

	SYNTAX		INTEGER (0..2147483647)
	ACCESS		read-write
	STATUS		mandatory
	DESCRIPTION	"For external entity, specifies the maximum
			port number of a range of ports.  Defaults to
			0, equivalent to specifying a single port number
			if fwallCtrlExtPort is nonzero."

	STATUS		mandatory
	DESCRIPTION	"This address may be supplied by the management

	SYNTAX		INTEGER

			date.  Until then, this variable really has no
			meaning."
