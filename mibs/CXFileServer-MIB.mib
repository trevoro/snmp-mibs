Options:
disabled (1): File server resources remain allocated to the activity or 
application that originally used them, even if they are no longer 
required.

	 DESCRIPTION
"Determines the type of file transfer action to be taken with the file 
specified by the cxFsTransferFileName object.

The status of a transfer process can be obtained from the 
cxFsTransferStatus object. Multiple simultaneous file transfers are not 
supported. Therefore, if the value of the cxFsTransferStatus object is 
'processing', no GET or PUT can be initiated.

Options:
no-action (1): No action taken with the specified file.

get (2): Retrieves the file specified by the cxFsTransferFileName object 
from the slot specified by the cxFsTransferDestSlot object to the master 
card.

put (3): Copies the file specified by the cxFsTransferFileName object from 
the master card to the slot specified by the cxFsTransferDestSlot object.

"Indicates whether any errors occurred during the last file transfer 
action initiated using the 'cxFsTransferAction' object. The 
cxFsTransferErrorCode object also indicates the nature of any errors that 
occur during file transfer.

not-applicable (1): No action taken; therefore, no error generated.

ok (2): No errors. The last file transfer operation was successfully 
completed.

local-open-error (3): Could not open the local file for which a PUT or GET 
command was issued.

nfs-open-error (4): Could not open the remote file for which a PUT or GET 
command was issued.

issued could not be read, or a remote file obtained through a GET command 
could not be read locally.

nfs-reading-error (6): Either a remote file PUT to a destination slot 
could not be read at that location, or a remote file for which a GET 
command was issued could not be read in the remote slot.

local-writing-error (7): The 'cxFsTransferAction' object was unable to 
copy the specified file to the local directory.

nfs-writing-error (8): The 'cxFsTransferAction' object was unable to copy 
the specified file to the destination directory.
