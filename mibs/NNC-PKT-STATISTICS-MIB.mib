    DESCRIPTION "
      This module contains definitions for performance monitoring of the
      packets routed.

      This MIB module contains the following tables:
	PKT VCL 15 Minute Current Table
	PKT VCL 15 Minute Interval Table

      and the following non-table objects:
	nncDepthOfHistoricalStrata

      These tables are heavily influenced by the definition of VPL/VCL
      described in rfc1695, and by the statistic table definitions described
      in rfc2233. The number of intervals supported is dependent upon
      resource availibility on any given product, but should nominally
      be 32. To avoid building in massive amounts of storage, some products
      may adopt a bulk collection scheme. 

      Note that IP packets are counted because of rfc1483.

      Intervals:
	Statistics on the performance of VPL/VCLs are collected over a
	historical stratum of up to a maximum of M intervals. The value of M
	is a function of a product's storage capability. For example, on the
	36170 product, M = 1. Refer to a product's NEID document for a
	description of these limits.

	The intervals are 15 minutes and are aligned to
	the quarter of one hour of a wall clock. The current
	interval spans back to the last 15 minute tick on the wall
	clock. Continuing along the timeline from that point is the most
	recently completed interval and has an index of 1. The previous
	interval has an index of 2 and so on. Note that the oldest interval
	may be incomplete since the statistic collection may have been
	enabled offset to the quarter or one hour tick.

--      Action Items
--      A1 - Jason Paau to update the MIB as indicated in D1 and as
--           resulting from the action items below.  To be completed
--           by 1998.01.30.

--           1998.01.30   Document has been updated and submitted for
--                        check-in.
-- 
--      A2 - David Fowler to determine the values of CoSType by taking

--
--      Decisions
--      D1 - The file PKTStatistics will be updated in the following places:
--        a) Add CoS to VclStatEntry
--        b) Use Pkt as part of the name for accumulated stats
--        c) Update definitions for octet objects to indicate that they
--           count AAL5 payload only.  ATM or AAQL overhead is not counted.
--        d) Fix compliance statement to reflect only devices which perform
--           Bridging or IP Routing over ATM support this MIB.
--        e) Remove depth of historical strata
--        f) Remove counter tables and compliances
