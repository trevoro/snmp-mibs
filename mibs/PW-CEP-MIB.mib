      DESCRIPTION 
          "Based on the PWE3 Requirements/Framework, the original 
           CEM MIB (draft-danenberg-sonet-ces-mpls-mib-00.txt) has 
           Been split into 3 drafts: 
    
             - PW-MIB     (Zelig, et al).  Service-independent MIB. 
             - PW-TC-MIB  (Nadeau, et al). Textual Conventions. 
             - PW-CEM-MIB (Danenberg, et al). Service-specific MIB. 
    
           Aside from the split, then PW-CEM-MIB has undergone 
           other changes: 
    
             - Ability to define LOPS (loss of packet sync), SES 
               and UAS. 
             - Support for 'unstructured' operation. 
             - Support for CEM-RDI. 
             - Many more minor changes and clarifications."

           missingPkt - While playing out a sequence of packets, 
           a packet(s) was determined to be missing based on 
           a gap in the CEP sequence number. Note: If the imple- 
           mentation supports packet re-ordering, detecting gaps 
           should not take place as packets arrive, only as they 
           are played out - this gives time for mis-ordered packets 
           to arrive late. 
            
           ooRngDropped - Packet(s) arrives that is outside the 
           range of the jitter buffer. This may be because the 
           jitter buffer is full, or the sequence number addresses 
           a buffer outside the current jitter buffer range, or 
           addresses an already occupied buffer within range. 
           Whether or not packet re-ordering is supported by the 
           implementation, this indication MUST be supported. 
            
           jtrBfrUnder - The jitter buffer underflowed due to 
           not enough packets arriving as packets were being 
     
    
           played out.  
            
           pktBadLength - Non-bandwidth-saving packet arrives 
           larger or smaller than pwVcCepCfgSonetPayloadLength, or when 
           a fractional SPE packet length does not match the extension 
           header or manual configuration indicating the number of  
           equipped VTs.  
            
           lops - Loss Of Packet Sync. See draft-ietf-pwe3-sonet. 
            
           cepRdi - Circuit Emulation over Packet Remote 
           Defect Indication. Generated by the remote CEP 
           de-packetizer when detecting LOPS. Note: not gen- 
           erated by the remote SONET function. See draft-ietf- 
           pwe3-sonet. 
            
           cepAis - Remote CEP packetizer has detected AIS 
           on its incoming SONET stream. See draft-ietf-pwe3- 
           sonet. Note: cepAis MUST NOT (in itself) cause a CEP 
           down notification. This would be a layer violation. 
    
           badHdrStack - This indication is set when the number of 
           CEP header extensions detected in incoming packets does 
           not match the expected number. 
           
           Note: currently there is no hierarchy of CEP defects. 
    
           Note: the algorithm used to capture these indications 
           is implementation specific."
