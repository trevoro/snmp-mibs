--	This MIB is also known as the Backplane protocol MIB.  It provides
--	a list of MAC and IP addresses known for each physical module within
--	the chassis.  Physical modules are identified by the slot in which
--	they reside.

DESCRIPTION
 	"This object reports on the status of the backplane protocol heartbeat.
        This object is applicable only to intelligent MIMs residing in an MMAC
        chassis.

	If the heartbeat is detected from the management module (i.e. the
	intelligent MIM is in communication with the management module) then
        the value returned by this object is heartBeatPresent(1).

	If the heartbeat is not present, then the returned value is
	heartBeatAbsent(2).

	On intelligent MIMs that do not support the backplane protocol and
	management modules the value notSupported(3) is returned."
