          -- The History Group

          -- The History group is based on etherHistory.
          -- It uses the existing historyControlTable table.
          --
          -- The history group records periodic statistical samples from
          -- a network and stores them for later retrieval.  The
          -- historyControl table stores configuration entries that each
          -- define an interface, polling period, and other parameters.
          -- Once samples are taken, their data is stored in an entry
          -- in a media-specific table.  Each such entry defines one
          -- sample, and is associated with the historyControlEntry that
          -- caused the sample to be taken.  
          --
          -- If the probe keeps track of the time of day, it should
          -- start the first sample of the history at a time such that
          -- when the next hour of the day begins, a sample is
          -- started at that instant.  This tends to make more
          -- user-friendly reports, and enables comparison of reports
          -- from different probes that have relatively accurate time
          -- of day.
          --
          -- The monitor is encouraged to add two history control entries
          -- per monitored interface upon initialization that describe
          -- a short term and a long term polling period.  Suggested
