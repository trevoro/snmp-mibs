		DESCRIPTION
				"The MIB module for the PVC Table"
	::= { aiSLC2 1 }

   IANAifType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
       STATUS       current
       DESCRIPTION
               "This data type is used as the syntax of the ifType
               object in the (updated) definition of MIB-II's
               ifTable.

               The definition of this textual convention with the
               addition of newly assigned values is published
               periodically by the IANA, in either the Assigned
               Numbers RFC, or some derivative of it specific to
               Internet Network Management number assignments.  (The
               latest arrangements can be obtained by contacting the
               IANA.)

               Requests for new values should be made to IANA via
               email (iana@isi.edu).

               The relationship between the assignment of ifType
               values and of OIDs to particular media-specific MIBs
               is solely the purview of IANA and is subject to change
               without notice.  Quite often, a media-specific MIB's
               OID-subtree assignment within MIB-II's 'transmission'
               subtree will be the same as its ifType value.
               However, in some circumstances this will not be the
               case, and implementors must not pre-assume any
               specific relationship between ifType values and
               transmission subtree OIDs."

		DESCRIPTION

"
Entries define permanent virtual circuits (PVCs) in the system.  Each
entry contains enough information to create one PVC on one network
interface.

Each entry may also contain the information required to create another
circuit in the system, of any kind.  This other circuit we will call a
companion circuit, since eventually it is going to be connected to the
PVC defined in the same entry.  This connection information does not
need to be present, but may be, to allow for a rapid association
between a PVC and its companion circuit.

		MAX-ACCESS	read-write

		DESCRIPTION

The index into the interfaces group of MIB-II, which defines the
particular subnetwork on which this PVC will be created.  This index
corresponds to what AII calls a link.

		DESCRIPTION
"
The individual circuit number on the subnetwork (defined by
aiPVCIfIndex), to which the PVC defined by this entry is mapped.

In X.25, this number maps directly to a Logical Channel Number.

In Frame Relay, this number maps directly to a DLCI.

a PVC is located.

		STATUS		current

		DESCRIPTION
"
The time, in seconds, between successive attempts to create a
composite circuit comprising the PVC defined in this entry, and its
companion circuit.

When a PVC is created, if its aiPVCCallTimer is greater than zero,
then the PVC will attempt to connect to a remote host (as specified
elsewhere).  If the connection attempt times out before completion,
then the PVC will try again after aiPVCCallTimer seconds.
"

		MAX-ACCESS	read-write
		STATUS		current

		DESCRIPTION
"
The time, in seconds, of inactivity on a composite circuit before
a PVC will tear down the composite circuit.

Once a composite circuit has been created, comprising a PVC and its
companion circuit, then if the PVC's aiPVCInactivityTimer is greater
than zero, and if no data passes through the composite circuit in
either direction for aiPVCInactivityTimer seconds, then the PVC
will close the composite circuit.
