   RowState ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
       STATUS       current
       DESCRIPTION "
              This textual-convention provides a means
              to represent the state of a conceptual row;
              it does not provide a means to manage creation
              and/or destruction of conceptual rows.

              In any row which includes a definition of RowState
              that is also mandatory, that row MUST contain
              an instantiation of a RowState object if any other
              object in the same row is instantiated.

              A status column of this type has three defined
              values:

                 - `active', which indicates that the
                 conceptual row is in use by the managed
                 device and is considered fully operational
                 from a management perspective;

                 - `notInService', which indicates that the
                 conceptual row is available for use by
                 the managed device but is NOT considered
                 fully operational from a management
                 perspective; a row in this state contains
                 all information necessary for a transition to
                 the active state;
                 - `notReady', which indicates that the
                 conceptual row is not available for use
                 by the managed device, perhaps because the
                 row is missing information or the row has
                 been explicitly set to this state;

              Any of the three states may be specified in a
              management protocol set operation. At any time,
              the value of an existing RowState object may be
              modified or changed to any other state unless
              the current value is notReady and the row (after
              completion of a management set operation) would
              not be consistent with an active state (i.e.
              information is missing or inconsistent and as a
              result the row could not assume an active state
              until further management set operations were
              performed). In this case, the value MUST remain
              at notReady and an inconsistentValue error is
              returned.

              A RowState object whose value is notReady MUST
              implicitly promote itself from notReady to
              notInService if any management protocol set
              operation not referencing the status column
              explicitly changes the value of any other object
              in the same row AND the row afterward is now
              consistent with the active state (i.e all
              information needed to make the row active is
              available).

              When a row does not exist, and a management
              protocol set operation causes any object in the row
              to be created, the status object will also be
              instantiated and its initial value will be determined
              by the first of the following rules that are satisfied:

                 1. if the set operation includes an initial value,
                    the RowState object will take on the highest
                    value (i.e. active is highest) consistent with
                    the state definitions, but no higher than the
                    provided value. For example, if a set operation
                    contains a varbind where RowState=notInService
                    (or active), the initial value will be notReady
                    if the row is in an inconsistent state after the
                    operation is complete; otherwise, it will be
                    notInService (or active).

                 2. if the set operation does not include an initial
                    value, but the RowState definition does include
                    a supported DEFVAL, the initial value will be the
                    highest value consistent with the state definitions
                    but no higher than the value specified in the
                    DEFVAL, unless the DEFVAL specifies a value of
                    notReady, which in this case, the DEFVAL is ignored
                    (i.e. case 3 below instead applies).

                 3. otherwise, the set operation does not include an
                    initial value, and the RowState definition does
                    not include a DEFVAL, and the initial value will
                    be set to the highest value consistent with the
                    state definitions. Thus, the initial state will
                    be active if the new row is consistent with that
                    state, or it will be notReady otherwise.

              No constraint is imposed on whether other objects
              in the same row can be modified, regardless of the
              value of the associated RowState object. If such
              constraints are desired, they MUST be explicitly
              stated in the DESCRIPTION clause of the status column.
              In the absence of such statements, the managed device
              MUST allow any object in any row to be modified at
              any time, notwithstanding the possibility that other
              MIB objects MAY also impose similar constraints.
              An inconsistentValue error is returned when an invalid
              attempt is made to alter a row whose state precludes
              such an operation.

              RowState description clauses, in addition to
              the DESCRIPTION clauses of associated column
              objects, SHOULD together describe the general
              conditions under which a row can be made active.
              In the absence of such statements, any row SHOULD
              generally be capable of being made active at any
              time.

              The agent must detect conceptual rows that
              have been in the notReady state for an abnormally
              long period of time and remove them. It is the
              responsibility of the DESCRIPTION clause of the
              status column to indicate what an abnormally long
              period of time would be. This period of time should
              be long enough to allow for human response time
              (including `think time') between the creation of the
              conceptual row and the setting of the status to `active'.
              In the absense of such information in the DESCRIPTION
              clause, it is suggested that this period be approximately
              5 minutes in length. This removal action applies not only
              to newly-created rows, but also to previously active rows
              which are set to, and left in, the notReady state for a
              prolonged period exceeding that which is considered normal
              for such a conceptual row."
