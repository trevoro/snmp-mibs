"Indicates the status of a failed connection. The value of this object is

Options:
noFailure (1): Once a system route has been successfully connected,
               this value is maintained for the duration of the connection.

internalError (2): An internal error has occurred.

localAllocFailure (3): There is insufficient memory available for ATM DXI
                       to establish this connection.

                        protocol layer to establish this connection.

localNoAccess (5): This route is associated with a SAP that does not exist.

remoteNoAccess (6): This route is associated with a SAP that does not exist 
                    at the destination layer.

remotePvcDown (8): The PVC at the destination protocol layer is down.

remotePvcBusy (10): The destination associated with this route is already connected. 
                    This typically occurs when the route is a non-MPE (PVC consolidating)
                    circuit.

localFcnFailure (11): Flow control negotiation failed.

remoteFcnFailure (12): Flow control negotiation failed at the destination protocol layer.

localDsnFailure (13): Data size negotiation failed.

remoteAliasNotFound (15): The destination alias (atmDxiSRDestAlias) does not exist.

remoteNoPvcService (16): The destination protocol layer does not support PVC service.

routeStalled (18): An invalid control packet exchange has occurred during the route 
                   setup procedure.  The route is temporarily stalled but will recover
