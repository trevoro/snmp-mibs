-- Routing RouteSelector
-- This component sits directly under the Routing component. It is 
-- dynamically created by Routing System and thus is always present 
-- when PORS software is loaded on a Passport node. RouteSelector is 
-- used by PORS services for the following purposes:
-- - Selecting a route to a destination through the current topology 
-- region. The route may be directly to the destination node or to a 
-- gateway node through which the destination can be reached.
-- - Returning a manual route stored as part of manual path profile.
-- 
-- RouteSelector is invoked with a route request data containing one of 
-- the following:
-- - Parameters which must be met by the selected route.
-- - Parameter profile reference where parameters which must be met 
-- by the selected route are stored.
-- - Manual path profile reference.
-- 
-- When the route request data contains a manual path profile 
-- reference then RouteSelector returns the manual path route 
-- associated with that reference. The manual path route is returned in 
-- the selected route description data. RouteSelector does not verify 
-- the manual path route. 
-- 
-- When the route request data contains parameter profile reference 
-- then RouteSelector obtains route request data parameters associated 
-- with that reference and then proceeds as though the parameters 
-- were contained in the route request data.
-- 
-- Using the route request data parameters, RouteSelector uses a route 
-- selection algorithm, based on Dijkstra's Shortest-Path-First 
-- algorithm, to select the best route to the destination. That route may 
-- be directly to the destination node or to a gateway node through 
-- which the destination can be reached. The selected route must 
-- satisfy all the route request data parameters. The route selection is 
-- done against the current view of the topological database 
-- maintained by Routing Topology System of the current topology 
-- region. Once the route is selected, selected route description data is 
-- returned by RouteSelector.
-- 
-- RouteSelector can be used in two modes: automatic and manual. 
-- 
-- In the automatic mode, a route request message containing the route 
-- request data is originated by a PORS VC and sent to RouteSelector. 
-- RouteSelector then selects a route or gets a manual route and returns 
-- its description in the selected route description data in the selected 
-- route message back to the PORS VC.
-- 
-- In the manual mode, RouteSelector allows the operator to modify 
-- the parameters in the route request data (except for the manual path 
-- profile reference), and to initiate route selection using that data. 
-- When RouteSelector selects the route it displays its description to 
-- the operator.

mscRtgRsBumpingPriority OBJECT-TYPE

   STATUS     mandatory
   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute indicates the priority at which a route has been 
      selected, or a value of 4 for manual routes since no route selection 
      was made. Since RouteSelector does not verify manual routes the 
      value of 4 for routeBumpingPriority symbolizes an unknown value 
      for manual routes. The remainder of the description is not 
      applicable to manual routes.
      
      The bumping priority of a route specifies a priority at which a path 
      along that route can be established. The lowest bumping priority is 
      4, the highest bumping priority is equal to a setup priority contained 
      in the route request data. If a route is selected at bumping priority 4, 
      then no paths will be bumped since there appears to be enough free 
      bandwidth on selected trunks, and also since this bumping priority 
      is not better than the lowest holding priority (4) of any path. 
      
      If a route cannot be selected at bumping priority 4 and a setup 
      priority is 3 or better, then a route may be selected at bumping 
      priority 3. This means that paths at holding priority 4 may be 
      bumped if currently there is not enough free bandwidth on selected 
      trunks to establish the new path with setup priority 3. 
      
      If a route cannot be selected at bumping priority 3 and a setup 
      priority is 2 or better, then a route may be selected at bumping 
      priority 2. In this case paths with holding priority 4 and 3 may be 
      bumped if there is not enough free bandwidth on selected trunks to 
      establish the new path with setup priority 2. 
      
      If a route cannot be selected at bumping priority 2 and a setup 
      priority is 1 or better, then a route may be selected at bumping 
      priority 1. In this case paths with holding priority 4, 3, and 2 may be 
      bumped if there is not enough free bandwidth on selected trunks to 
      establish the new path with setup priority 1.
      
      If a route cannot be selected at bumping priority 1 and a setup 
      priority is 0, then a route may be selected at bumping priority 0. In 
      this case paths with holding priority 4, 3, 2, and 1 may be bumped if 
      there is not enough free bandwidth on selected trunks to establish 
      the new path with setup priority 0."

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute indicates the reason for which a route was not 
      selected by RouteSelector. 
      
      If the route was selected then reasonForNoRoute has a value of 
      none.
      
      If the destination in the form of ASCII name was specified (see 
      destination) and the name of node is too long (more than 12 
      characters) then reasonForNoRoute has a value of 
      destinationNameTooLong. Check and correct node name in the 
      destination attribute.
      
      If the destination was not specified, that is destination is blank, then 
      reasonForNoRoute has a value of destinationNotSpecified. 
      Destination attribute should not be blank.
      
      If the destination in the form of ASCII name was specified (see 
      destination) and the name of node cannot be found in topological 
      database then reasonForNoRoute has a value of 
      unknownDestinationName. Check and correct node name in the 
      destination attribute. If it is correct then this node does not appear in 
      local topological database as this node may lie across the topology 
      region or cluster boundary.
      
      If the destination cannot be found in the topological database or 
      cannot be reached through any gateway node then 
      reasonForNoRoute has a value of unknownDestination. Ensure the 
      destination specified in destination attribute resides in the topology 
      region, or can be reached through a Routing Gateway. That is, at 
      least one reachable address provisioned under a Trunk Address 
      component representing a gateway link can reach the destination 
      NSAP address.
      
      If the destination was specified using an incorrect format (see 
      destination) then reasonForNoRoute has a value of 
      incorrectDestination. Use the correct format for destination 
      attribute.
      
      If there is no physical connectivity to the destination or gateway 
      node, or number of hops to such node exceeds a limit of 20 hops, or 
      a route to such node cannot satisfy all the parameters in the route 
      request data then reasonForNoRoute has a value of 
      attributeNotMet. Set operationMode to manual and issue d rtg rs 
      command and inspect attributeNotMet to determine which attribute 
      could not be satisfied.
      
      If the route to the destination could not be selected for some internal 
      reason then reasonForNoRoute has a value of internalReason. A 
      Software Alarm generated in association with this situation should 
      be reported to Nortel Networks technical support.
      
      If the route to the destination could not be selected because of 
      profile reference problem then reasonForNoRoute has a value of 
      attributeProfileProblem.
      
      If the route to the destination could not be selected because of 
      manual path reference problem then reasonForNoRoute has a value 
      of manualPathIndexProblem.

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute indicates the name of a possible route request data 
      parameter which prevents RouteSelector from selecting the route. 
      This attribute always has a value of allAttributesMet for manual 
      routes since RouteSelector does not verify manual routes. This 
      attribute has a meaningful value if reasonForNoRoute attribute has 
      a value of attributesNotMet. The value of attributeNotMet is only 
      computed when RouteSelector operates in manual mode. That is, 
      when route selection has been initiated by the operator in which 
      case operationMode has a value of manual. 
      
      RouteSelector determines which of the attributes: 
      requiredRxBandwidth, requiredTxBandwidth, requiredTrunkModes, 
      maximumAcceptableCost, maximumAcceptableDelay, 
      maximumAcceptableGatewaCost, requiredTrafficType, 
      permittedTrunkTypes, requiredSecurity, 
      requiredCustomerParameter, and maximumTransmissionUnit 
      prevents successful route selection by dropping the constraints 
      associated with that attribute and reselecting the route. If that route 
      can be successfully selected then the attribute for which the 
      constraints were dropped is the attribute preventing successful route 
      selection. 
      
      For example, RouteSelector drops bandwidth constraints by 
      selecting a route with requiredRxBandwidth or 
      requiredTxBandwidth of 0. If the route can be selected then 
      bandwidth is preventing successful route selection.
      
      A value of unknownAttributeNotMet indicates that RouteSelector 
      cannot determine why route cannot be selected. Constraints for all 
      attributes are dropped yet successful route cannot be computed. 
      This usually indicates a lack physical connectivity to the destination 
      or gateway node. Alternatively, this may indicate that destination or 
      gateway node is more than 20 hops away where 20 hops is the 
      maximum number of hops in the route."

      value of sameNode. 
      
      If the destination resides on a different node and can be reached

      gateway selection algorithm was used (see 
      gatewaySelectionAlgorithm).
      
      If the destination can be reached indirectly through a gateway node 
      with the gateway node being different from the current node then 
      routeType has a value of gatewayNode or gatewayLink depending 
      on whether or not the route consists of a single gateway link. A 
      route consists of a single gateway link only when the route 
      requestor (see routeRequestor) is a Routing Gateway (in inbound or 
      outbound direction) and the route leads immediately across 
      topology region or cluster boundary.

      Note that the type of route, except for manual route, depends on 
      who is the route requestor (application service, Routing Gateway 
      serving as inbound or outbound gateway), where it resides (gateway 
      or non-gateway node), how the destination can be reached (directly 
      or indirectly through a gateway node), and what is the gateway 
      selection algorithm (cost-based, random or legacy)."

     "This attribute indicates the mode in which the RouteSelector is

      In the automatic mode, a route request message containing the route 
      request data is originated by a PORS VC and sent to the 
      RouteSelector. RouteSelector then selects a route or gets a manual 
      route and returns its description in the selected route description 
      data in the selected route message back to the PORS VC.
      
      In the manual mode, the RouteSelector allows the operator to 
      modify the parameters in the route request data (except for the 
      manual path profile reference), and to initiate route selection using 
      that data. When RouteSelector selects the route it displays its 
      description to the operator.

      during its staging, the trunk measures a measuredRoundTripDelay. 
      This delay is divided by two and truncated to an integer number of 
      milliseconds to provide a one way delay which is used to populate 
      the delay in this trunk object in the topological database. The value 
      includes emission, propagation, and queuing delays. A 512 byte

      larger than the maximumAcceptableDelay, then that trunk is not 
      considered during the route selection.

      done for any minimization criterion. No route is selected if the

   DESCRIPTION
     "This attribute indicates the reason for the most recent failure for an 
      attempted connection using this ManualPath's route. The following 
      is a brief description of the reasons:
      none - This path has no information for the teardown.
      insufficientTxLcOrBandwidth - At present there is either no 
      available bandwidth or logical channel numbers available on one or 
      more of the Trunks for this path in the transmit direction. If a trunk 
      in the route attribute was previously locked, or has a Trk PA 
      subcomponent that is not in the up state , that Trunk is considered 
      as having no available bandwidth. If the Trunk PA is in mapped 
      mode, the inability to allocate an Atmif Vcc also results in this 
      failure reason. 
      insufficientRxLcOrBandwidth - At present there is either no 
      available bandwidth or logical channel numbers available on one or 
      more of the Trunks for this path in the receive direction. If a trunk 
      in the route attribute was previously locked, or has a Trk PA 
      subcomponent that is not in the up state , that Trunk is considered 
      as having no available bandwidth.
      trunkFailure- A Trunk on the path has failed or has gone down, 
      due to a provisioning change of a critical attribute, as the path was 
      being established.
      trunkCardFailure- A Trunk FP card has failed along the path as the 
      path was being established.
      accessCardFailure- The FP on which the peer access service was 
      running has failed as the path was being established.
      operatorForced- The path has terminated due to the operator 
      locking a Trunk along the path as the path was being established.
      lostLcnClash- The path has terminated because the Trk PA's at both 
      ends of an intermediate trunk have allocated the same Trk LC to 
      different calls. When this happens both calls must go down and then 
      try to come up again a fraction of a second later (effectively 
      ensuring that they will now be assigned different Trk LC's). It is 
      normal to get the odd clash especially when the Trk PA usedLC is 
      approaching the Trk PA maxLC. An LCN clash results in the path 
      failing to instantiate only if the application disabled rerouting. By 
      default rerouting is enabled for all applications. Applications can 
      disable rerouting by using a Rtg Pors Prof/n component with 
      pathFailureAction set to disconnectConnection.
      networkCongestion - The path has failed to establish due to control 
      information being lost and not being recoverable.
      trunkNotFound - Check for Trunks not up or names provisioned 
      incorrectly in route attribute . 
      farEndNotFound - The far end is not provisioned or is not up. The 
      called NSAP address cannot be reached through the last node in the 
      Rtg Pors ManualPath path.
      farEndBusy - The far end has been reached but it is busy. Check 
      remote end provisioning.
      unknownReason - The failure was not resolved.
      farEndNotReady - The remote end was reached but the connection 
      was refused due to the remote end not being enabled.
      serviceTypeMismatch - The remote service type does not match 
      this service type. Check provisioning.
      bumped - Another call bumped this path, as it was being 
      established, from a trunk to get bandwidth (or an LC) which it 
      required to come up. This other path had a higher setupPriority than 
      this path's holdingPriority hence it was allowed to steal the 
      bandwidth (or LC) from this path. A manual path that is bumped 
      fails to instantiate if it cannot bump another path along the same 
      route, or if it has pathFailureAction set to disconnectConnection.
      trunkOrFarEndDidNotSupportMode - This call was unable to 
      complete because a mode required by the service was not supported 
      by one of the Trunks the route went through or by the far end 
      service it connected to. Currently the only mode that this applies to 
      is the map/mux mode on Trk Pa Atm component."
