    DESCRIPTION
     "This MIB Module defines the CommWorks private interface
      to the Simple Network Time Protocol client process.
      The process can be configured with up to two alternate servers,
      a primary server and a secondary server. The primary server is
      always contacted first, the secondary server is contacted after
      all retransmissions to the primary failed have failed.
      The implementation is based on RFC 2030, using unicast mode
      only.
      Note that all the writable objects include a 'DEFVAL'
      clause. The clause is intended to be used as a reference only,
      in case an agent has no previously saved configuration.
      Typically, at start-up, an agent will load data saved from a
      previous session - thus 'DEFVAL' is used mainly for new
      systems."
