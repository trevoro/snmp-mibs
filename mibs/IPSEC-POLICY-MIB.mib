         bytes of the beginning of the packet to place in the log.
         Values greater than the size of the packet being processed
         indicate that the entire packet should be sent.

         classify groups of rules or subgroups together in order to
         achieve a greater degree of control and optimization over the
         execution order of the items within the group.  If the filter
         evaluates to false, the rule or subgroup will be skipped and
         the next rule or subgroup will be evaluated instead.

         An example usage of this object would be to limit a group of
         rules to executing only when the IP packet being process is
         designated to be processed by IKE.  This effecitevly creates
         a group of IKE specific rules.

         changed unless all the appropriate columns needed by the new
         value to be imposed on this object have been appropriately
         configured.

         The various tests definable in this table are as follows:

         sourceAddress:
           - Tests if the source address in the packet lies between
             the ipspIpHeadFiltSrcAddressBegin and
             ipspIpHeadFiltSrcAddressEnd objects.

             Note that setting these two objects to the same address
             will limit the search to the exact match of a single
             address.  The format and length of the address objects
             are defined by the ipspIpHeadFiltIPVersion column.
             A row in this table containing a ipspIpHeadFiltType
             object with the sourceAddress object bit but without the
             ipspIpHeadFiltIPVersion, ipspIpHeadFiltSrcAddressBegin
             and ipspIpHeadFiltSrcAddressEnd objects set will cause
             the ipspIpHeadFiltRowStatus object to return the notReady
             state.

         destinationAddress:
           - Tests if the destination address in the packet lies
             between the ipspIpHeadFiltDstAddressBegin and
             ipspIpHeadFiltDstAddressEnd objects.  Note that setting
             these two objects to the same address will limit the
             search to the exact match of a single address.  The
             format and length of the address objects are defined by
             the ipspIpHeadFiltIPVersion column.

             A row in this table containing a ipspIpHeadFiltType
             object with the destinationAddress object bit but without
             the ipspIpHeadFiltIPVersion,
             ipspIpHeadFiltDstAddressBegin and

             ipspIpHeadFiltDstAddressEnd objects set will cause the
             ipspIpHeadFiltRowStatus object to return the notReady
             state.

         sourcePort:
           - Tests if the source port of IP packets using a protocol
             that uses port numbers (at this time, UDP or TCP) lies
             between the ipspIpHeadFiltSrcLowPort and
             ipspIpHeadFiltSrcHighPort objects.  Note that setting
             these two objects to the same address will limit the
             search to the exact match of a single port.

             A row in this table containing a ipspIpHeadFiltType
             object with the sourcePort object bit but without the
             ipspIpHeadFiltSrcLowPort, and ipspIpHeadFiltSrcHighPort
             objects set will cause the ipspIpHeadFiltRowStatus object
             to return the notReady state.

         destinationPort:
           - Tests if the source port of IP packets using a protocol
             that uses port numbers (at this time, UDP or TCP) lies
             between the ipspIpHeadFiltDstLowPort and
             ipspIpHeadFiltDstHighPort objects.  Note that setting
             these two objects to the same address will limit the
             search to the exact match of a single port.

             A row in this table containing a ipspIpHeadFiltType
             object with the sourcePort object bit but without the
             ipspIpHeadFiltDstLowPort, and ipspIpHeadFiltDstHighPort
             objects set will cause the ipspIpHeadFiltRowStatus object
             to return the notReady state.

         protocol:
           - Tests to see if the packet being processed is for the
             given protocol type.

             A row in this table containing a ipspIpHeadFiltType
             object with the protocol object bit but without the
             ipspIpHeadFiltProtocol object set will cause the
             ipspIpHeadFiltRowStatus object to return the notReady
             state.

         ipv6FlowLabel:
           - Tests to see if the packet being processed contains an
             ipv6 Flow Label which matches the value in the
             ipfIPv6FlowLabel object.  Setting this bit mandates that
             for the packet to match the filter, it must be an IPv6
             packet.

             A row in this table containing a ipspIpHeadFiltType
             object with the ipv6FlowLabel object bit but without the
             ipfIPv6FlowLabel object set will cause the

         or ipspIpOffFiltValue, needed by the new value to be imposed
         on this object have been appropriately configured.

         The various tests definable in this table are as follows:

         valueMatch:
           - Tests if the OCTET STRING, 'ipspIpOffFiltValue', matches
             a value in the packet starting at the given offset in the
             packet and comparing the entire OCTET STRING of

           - Tests if the OCTET STRING, 'ipspIpOffFiltValue', does not
             match a value in the packet starting at the given offset
             in the packet and comparing to the entire OCTET STRING of
             'ipspIpOffFiltValue'.

         arithmeticEqual:

             arithmetically equal ('=') to the 4 byte value starting
             at the given offset within the packet.  The value in the
             packet is assumed to be in network byte order.

         arithmeticNotEqual:
           - Tests if the Integer32, 'ipspIpOffFiltNumber', is
             arithmetically not equal ('!=') to the 4 byte value
             starting at the given offset within the packet.  The
             value in the packet is assumed to be in network byte
             order.

         arithmeticLess:
           - Tests if the Integer32, 'ipspIpOffFiltNumber', is
             arithmetically less than ('<') the 4 byte value starting
             at the given offset within the packet.  The value in the
             packet is assumed to be in network byte order.

         arithmeticGreaterOrEqual:
           - Tests if the Integer32, 'ipspIpOffFiltNumber', is
             arithmetically greater than or equal to ('>=') the 4 byte
             value starting at the given offset within the packet.
             The value in the packet is assumed to be in network byte
             order.

         arithmeticGreater:

             arithmetically greater than ('>') the 4 byte value
             starting at the given offset within the packet.  The
             value in the packet is assumed to be in network byte
             order.

         arithmeticLessOrEqual:
           - Tests if the Integer32, 'ipspIpOffFiltNumber', is
             arithmetically less than or equal to ('<=') the 4 byte
             value starting at the given offset within the packet.
