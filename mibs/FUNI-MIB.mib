-- The FUNI MIB contains three tables which allow FUNI specific configuration
-- and access to FUNI specific statistics. In addition to the MIB groups 
-- defined here access will be required to the IF-MIB and the AToM-MIB in order
-- to configure manage the physical interface and the ATM connections respecively.
--
-- FUNI V2.0 supports four different Modes of operation. Modes 1a and 1b are the same
-- as in the V1.0 specification. Modes 3 and 4 are optional and new to V2.0.
-- All modes with the exception of Mode 4 have a two byte FUNI header. Mode 4 has a
-- four byte FUNI header.
-- Modes 3 and 4 always have a 32 bit CRC and support a minimum SDU size of 9232
-- octets. These modes only support AAL5.
-- Mode 1a and 1b support a minimum SDU size of 4096 octets and either a 16 bit
-- or 32 bit CRC. Both modes support AAL5 and Mode 1b also supports AAL3/4.
--
-- The tables contained in this MIB are:-
--    FUNI Interface Configuration Table
--    FUNI Interface Statistics Table
--    FUNI Virtual Connection Statistics Table
