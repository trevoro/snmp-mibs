	DESCRIPTION  
			"The MIB module for bridge and spanning tree protocol.  This
			mib  is based on RFC 1493 with modifications to support
			multiple  bridges, one for each virtual LAN (VLAN), in one
			physical chassis.  The bridge protocol attributes are now in
			a table indexed by the  vLanNumber.  The port number used to
			index various tables is now a  virtual port number
			corresponding to the virtual port defined in the
			SWITCH-VLAN-MIB."
    REVISION "9704182200Z"
    DESCRIPTION
			"Corrected names to switchBridge because of possible identifier.
			
			Corrected the MAX-ACCESS clause for writable objects in the
			switchBridgeStaticEntry from read-write to read-create. Modified
			description of switchBridgeStaticAllowedToGoTo.  This object is
			also read-only because it maps to the set of ports in a VLAN.
			
			Removed the mib compiler specific extensions into a separate
			file."

		      significant bit represents the lowest numbered
		      port, and the least significant bit represents the
		      highest numbered port.  Thus, each port of the
		      bridge is represented by a single bit within the
		      value of this object.  If that bit has a value of
		      '1' then that port is included in the set of
