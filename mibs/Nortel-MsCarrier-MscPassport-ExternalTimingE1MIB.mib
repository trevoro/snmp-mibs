      defined as a multi-valued set, at most one value is shown to the user.
      
      When no values are in the set, this indicates that either the attribute 
      is not supported or that none of the status conditions described 
      below are present.
      
      The value inTest indicates that the resource is undergoing a test 
      procedure. If adminState is locked or shuttingDown, the normal 
      users are precluded from using the resource and controlStatus is 
      reservedForTest. Tests that do not exclude additional users can be 
      present in any operational or administrative state but the 
      reservedForTest condition should not be present.
      
      The value failed indicates that the component has an internal fault 
      that prevents it from operating. The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value dependency indicates that the component cannot operate 
      because some other resource on which it depends is unavailable. 
      The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value powerOff indicates the resource requires power to be 
      applied and it is not powered on. The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value offLine indicates the resource requires a routine 
      operation (either manual, automatic, or both) to be performed to 
      place it on-line and make it available for use. The operationalState 
      is disabled.
      
      The value offDuty indicates the resource is inactive in accordance 
      with a predetermined time schedule. In the absence of other 
      disabling conditions, the operationalState is enabled or disabled.
      
      The value degraded indicates the service provided by the 
      component is degraded in some way, such as in speed or operating 
      capacity. However, the resource remains available for service. The 
      operationalState is enabled.

      The value initializationRequired indicates (for a resource which 
      doesn't initialize autonomously) that initialization is required before 
      it can perform its normal functions, and this procedure has not been 
      initiated. The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value notInitialized indicates (for a resource which does

      perform its normal functions, and this procedure has not been 
      initiated. The operationalState may be enabled or disabled.
      
      The value initializing indicates that initialization has been initiated

      The value partOfServicesLocked indicates that part of the service is

      alarm has been entered. The AIS Alarm state is entered when AIS 
      defects have been observed and accumulated for 2.5 seconds +/- 0.5 
      second. An AIS defect is detected after having received less than 3 
      zeros in a 2048 bit period. If the AIS defects are intermittently 
      occurring, the AIS defect accumulator is decremented at a rate of 1/
      10 of the incrementing rate (alarm integration ratio of 1/10), with all 
      measurement based on a 200 ms polling cycle. The port goes into 
      an operational state of disabled for the duration of an AIS alarm 
      state. The AIS alarm state is cleared when AIS defects are absent 
      for 10 seconds +/- 0.5 second."
