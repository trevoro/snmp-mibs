--  This MIB module defines a minimal set of managed objects
--  for SNMP based management of Vertical's ISDN terminal 
--  interfaces. 
-- 
--  The structure of this MIB closely follows that of the
--  definition in RFC 2127, with the relative tree structure
--  of the variables unchanged. The following changes
--  are salient :
--  1)   All variables names as mentioned in RFC 2127 have been 
--       preceded by the letter "v" to reinforce the fact that 
--       this is vertical's private implementaion
--  2)   All deprecated items in RFC 2127 have been removed 
--       to provide better readability.
--  3)   All v2 specific data types have been replaced with
--       corresponding v1 data types. 
--  4)   Traps have redefined to reflect v1 syntax 
--  5)	 Vertical does not implement BRI mode - hence 
--		 IsdnBasicRateGroup of RFC 2127 has not been defined here.
--  6)	 The optional isdnMibEndpointGroup of RFC 2127 has not 
--		 been implemented since this was needed only for non ISDN
--		 Terminal Endpoints for a given D channel. Vertical's 
--		 implementaion will have just one Terminal Endpoint (ISDN) 
--		 for the D channel
--  7)   The RowStatus objects have been changed to snmp v1 compliant
--       EntryStatus objects (as defined in RFC 1271) for dynamic 
--       creation of rows.
--  8)   The TestAndIncr Textual Convention of snmp v2 (RFC 1903)
--       has been used here since it is a convenient way to obtain
--       new indices for row creation. TestAndIncr has been redefined 
--       here for this purpose.
--  9)   The snmp v2 MODULE-COMPLIANCE statement list has been taken
--       off. However all guidelines specified by this statement has 
--       been adhered to in this MIB.

--  This MIB is found in the private.enterprise.vertical
--  branch of the MIB tree.


-- The ISDN hardware interface (BRI or PRI) is represented
-- by a media specific ifEntry.
--
-- For basic rate lines, the media specifics for the physical interface
-- is defined in the physical interface group of the ISDN MIB.
-- The ifType for physical basic rate interfaces is isdns(75)
-- or isdnu(76), whichever is appropriate.
--
-- For primary rate, the media specifics are defined in the Trunk
-- MIB and the ifType has a value of ds1(18).

-- Each signaling channel is represented by an entry
-- in the isdnSignalingTable.
-- The signaling channel has an ifType value of isdn(63).
-- Each B channel is also represented as an entry
-- in the ifTable. The B channels have an ifType value
-- of ds0(81).
-- This model is used while defining objects and tables
-- for management.
-- The ISDN MIB allows sub-layers. For example, the data transfer
-- over a B channel may take place with PPP encapsulation. While the
-- ISDN MIB describes the D and B channels, a media specific MIB
-- for PPP can be used on a layered basis. This is as per
-- the interfaces MIB.

-- Textual conventions

--    DESCRIPTION
--            "Represents integer-valued information used for atomic
--            operations.  When the management protocol is used to specify
--            that an object instance having this syntax is to be
--            modified, the new value supplied via the management protocol
--            must precisely match the value presently held by the
--            instance.  If not, the management protocol set operation
--            fails with an error of `inconsistentValue'.  Otherwise, if
--            the current value is the maximum value of 2^31-1 (2147483647
--            decimal), then the value held by the instance is wrapped to
--            zero; otherwise, the value held by the instance is
--            incremented by one.  (Note that regardless of whether the
--            management protocol set operation succeeds, the variable-
--            binding in the request and response PDUs are identical.)
--
--            The value of the ACCESS clause for objects having this
--            syntax is either `read-write' or `read-create'.  When an
--            instance of a columnar object having this syntax is created,
--            any value may be supplied via the management protocol.
--
--            When the network management portion of the system is re-
--            initialized, the value of every object instance having this
--            syntax must either be incremented from its value prior to
--            the re-initialization, or (if the value prior to the re-
--            initialization is unknown) be set to a pseudo-randomly

             in outgoing call setup messages.

             It can be an EAZ (1TR6), a calling number (DSS1, ETSI)
             or any other number necessary to identify a signaling

             this is a zero length string. It is represented in
             DisplayString form.

             Incoming calls can also be identified by this number.
             If the Directory Number, i.e. the Called Number in
             incoming calls, is different to this number, the
             visdnDirectoryTable has to be used to specify all
             possible Directory Numbers.

             The format of this information largely depends on the type
             of switch or PBX the device is connected to. Therefore,
             the detailed format of this information is not
             specified and is implementation dependent.

             If possible, the agent should implement this information
             using the E.164 number format. In this case, the number
             must start with '+'. Otherwise, IA5 number digits must
             be used."
