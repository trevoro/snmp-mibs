--    This data type is used as the syntax of the ifType 
--    object in the (updated) definition of MIB-II's 
--    ifTable. 
--    
--    The definition of this textual convention with the 
--    addition of newly assigned values is published 
--    periodically by the IANA, in either the Assigned 
--    Numbers RFC, or some derivative of it specific to 
--    Internet Network Management number assignments.  (The 
--    latest arrangements can be obtained by contacting the 
--    IANA.) 
--    
--    Requests for new values should be made to IANA via 
--    email (iana@isi.edu). 
--    
--    The relationship between the assignment of ifType 
--    values and of OIDs to particular media-specific MIBs 
--    is solely the purview of IANA and is subject to change 
--    without notice.  Quite often, a media-specific MIB's 
--    OID-subtree assignment within MIB-II's 'transmission' 
--    subtree will be the same as its ifType value. 
--    However, in some circumstances this will not be the 
--    case, and implementors must not pre-assume any 
--    specific relationship between ifType values and 
--    transmission subtree OIDs.
