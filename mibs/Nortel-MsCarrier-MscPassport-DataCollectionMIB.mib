-- Collector/<dataType> 
-- There is a Collector for each data stream. It is a permanent 
-- component which resides on the active CP. Its main function is to 
-- coordinate collection of data from all its Agent subcomponents and 
-- distribute that data to the downstream applications which have 
-- requested it (for example, one or more Sessions or its Spooler 
-- subcomponent). It also coordinates the time-of-day accounting 
-- (TODA) schedules and spooled statistics probes.

      The user can enter the times in any order and duplicates are 
      prevented at data entry. There is a limit of 24 entries, which is 
      imposed at semantic check time. The collection times are triggered 
      in chronological order. A semantic check error is issued if any 2 
      entries are less than 1 hour apart or if any 2 entries are more than 12 
      hours apart (which implies that if any entries are provided, there 
      must be at least 2 entries).

      schedule), a Virtual Circuit (VC) starts its own 12-hour accounting 
      timer. If any collection times are provisioned here, then the Time-
      Of-Day-Accounting (TODA) method is used in place of 12-hour

      defined as a multi-valued set, at most one value is shown to the user.
      
      When no values are in the set, this indicates that either the attribute 
      is not supported or that none of the status conditions described 
      below are present.
      
      The value inTest indicates that the resource is undergoing a test 
      procedure. If adminState is locked or shuttingDown, the normal 
      users are precluded from using the resource and controlStatus is 
      reservedForTest. Tests that do not exclude additional users can be 
      present in any operational or administrative state but the 
      reservedForTest condition should not be present.
      
      The value failed indicates that the component has an internal fault 
      that prevents it from operating. The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value dependency indicates that the component cannot operate 
      because some other resource on which it depends is unavailable. 
      The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value powerOff indicates the resource requires power to be 
      applied and it is not powered on. The operationalState is disabled.
      
      The value offLine indicates the resource requires a routine 
      operation (either manual, automatic, or both) to be performed to 
      place it on-line and make it available for use. The operationalState 
      is disabled.
      
      The value offDuty indicates the resource is inactive in accordance 
      with a predetermined time schedule. In the absence of other 
      disabling conditions, the operationalState is enabled or disabled.
      
      The value degraded indicates the service provided by the 
      component is degraded in some way, such as in speed or operating 
      capacity. However, the resource remains available for service. The 
      operationalState is enabled.

      initiated. The operationalState is disabled.
