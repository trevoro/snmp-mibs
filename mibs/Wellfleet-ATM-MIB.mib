                The PLCP object reflects information about either DS1 or DS3

                this object for every ATM DS1 or DS3 UNI.
                The PLCP object is separated from the other ATM objects for
                two reasons.  First, there may be ATM UNIs which use physical
                media other than DS1 or DS3, and thus the PLCP object may not
                apply to them.  Second, the PLCP object may also be applied
                towards management of SMDS Interfaces (SIPs).
                This PLCP object is essentially a superset of the PLCP object
                described in the Internet Draft MIB for SMDS (SIPs).  It contains

                "The ATM VBR Table - CSU/DSU Resident
                The ATM Variable Bit Rate (VBR) object is one of several types
                of ATM Adaptation Layer (AAL) objects.
                The ATM VBR object reflects information about a VBR service
                carried by an ATM UNI on behalf of a DTE interface (e.g. a DXI).
                In particular, it contains both configuration and performance
                information about the Segmentation and Reassembly (SAR) sublayer
                and the Convergence Sublayer (CS).
                Each instance of the VBR object has only one corresponding DTE
                interface, and only one corresponding ATM UNI, although it may
                correspond to several VPI/VCIs within a particular ATM UNI.
                The VBR object optionally keeps some information
                on a per-VPI/VCI basis.
                It should be noted that in the ATM VBR MIB, the receive (transmit)
                direction refers to data received from (transmitted to)
                the ATM UNI interface.

                ** For DL200 and DL3200 DSUs, there is only one ATM UNI per DSU
                ** and only one AAL object (specifically VBR) per ATM UNI.
                ** For these products, the DSU does not perform the
                ** integrity checks for the VBR CS layer, and thus will not
                ** provide all variables for the VBR CS table.  The Router/Host
                ** is expected to perform these checks and provide these variables.

                "The ATM DXI Table - An entry in this table is either resident in
                the Wellfleet MIB or in the Digital Link MIB via the SNMP Proxy.
                The Component attribute determines local or remote residency.

                The ATM Data Exchange Interface (DXI) object reflects
                information about an ATM DXI interface between an ATM DSU
                and a Router/Host.  In particular, it contains both
                configuration and performance information specific to the DXI
                (ATM) interface.
                Each DXI instance typically corresponds to several (ATM)
                DXIADDRs.  The DXI object optionally keeps some information
                on a per-DXIADDR basis.
                Each instance of the DXI object typically has only one
                corresponding ATM -AAL object, but the MIB has been
                structured so that a DXI may have more than one.
                It should be noted that in the DXI MIB, the receive (transmit)
                direction refers to data received from (transmitted to)
                the ATM interface.

                With a 23-bit DXIADDR, the range of valid DXIADDR index values is
                1 thru 2**23 inclusive.  Note that the 23-bit binary DXIADDR field
                (with values 0 thru 2**23-1) from the Frame Relay header must be
                incremented by one to yield the DXIADDR index for accessing the
                tables in the MIB.  The DXIADDR consisting of all zeros (with
                corresponding MIB index value of 1) is reserved for the DXI
                Local Management Interface (LMI) with the DSU.

                DxiAddr ::= INTEGER (1..8388608)

                 ** For DL200 and DL3200 DSUs, there is only one ATM DXI per DSU

                 ** For these products, the mapping between the DXI (Frame Relay)
