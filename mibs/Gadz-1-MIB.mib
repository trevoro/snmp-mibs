                  local edits.

                  back nlZoningPolicyStatus until 'request_valid' is received.
                - user can validate that it has successfully 
                  locked zone policy control by reading back its own
                  address from nlZoningPolicyControlOwner. 
                - user (optionally) writes timeout value to	
                  nlZoningPolicyTimeout, and then continually reads
                  back nlZoningPolicyStatus until 'request_valid' is received.

                  nlZoningPolicyControl to clear existing ta
                  nlZoningPolicyControl to clear existing table and then
                  continually reads back nlZoningPolicyStatus until 
                  'request_valid' is received.
                - user continually adds zone OR zone member entries by 
                  writing to the appropriate objects using index 0 of the table,
                  and then continually reads
                  back nlZoningPolicyStatus until 'request_valid' is received.
                - after the last entry is made, user writes 'create_table' to
                  nlZoningPolicyControl, and then continually reads
                  back nlZoningPolicyStatus until 'request_valid' is received.
                - OR the user writes 'default-zoning-configuration' to load
                  the default zoning configuration and then continually reads
                  back nlZoningPolicyStatus until 'request_valid' is received.
                - user writes 'clear_owner' to nlZoningPolicyControl (or waits
                  for the zoning timeout to occur) to release ownership of
                  zoning policy configuration.
