                 Why is there a separate index?
                 Traditionally, ifIndex values are chosen by agents,

                 ifIndex to index the tables could complicate

                 (if each agent had special restrictions on ifIndex).

			to add an image:
			system image add 10.50.6.4 qa/ssr3000
			system image add 10.50.6.4 qa/ssr3000 primary-cm
			system image add 10.50.6.4 qa/ssr3000 primary-cm slot0

			system image add <host_name_of_tftp_server> qa/ssr3000 backup-cm slot1



			to choose an image, need:
			system image choose ssr3000
			system image choose ssr3000 primary-cm
			system image choose ssr3000 primary-cm slot0
			system image choose ssr3000 primary-cm slot1

			system image choose ssr3000 backup-cm
			system image choose ssr3000 backup-cm slot0
			system image choose ssr3000 backup-cm slot1
			system image choose none
			system image choose none primary-cm
			system image choose none primary-cm slot0
			system image choose none primary-cm slot1
			system image choose none backup-cm
			system image choose none backup-cm slot0
			system image choose none backup-cm slot1

			to delete an image, need:
			system image delete ssr3000
			system image delete ssr3000 primary-cm
			system image delete ssr3000 primary-cm slot0
			system image delete ssr3000 primary-cm slot1
			system image delete ssr3000 backup-cm
			system image delete ssr3000 backup-cm slot0
			system image delete ssr3000 backup-cm slot1

			IMPORTANT: 
			ADD OPERATION: For adding an image to a flash card, 
                        there are two basic ways to do so:

			NOTE:  both cases use rsImageMibAction set to 2.

			case 1: use rsImageMibTftpServerAddress (or
			rsImageMibHostName), rsImageMibImageName and
			rsImageMibDestination.

			case 2: use rsImageMibTftpUrl.  Please note that the
			image will automatically be added to both Primary
			and Backup CMs if they are present, or to only the
			Primary CM if it alone is present.  (NOTE: One cannot
			specify the destination for the image add operation
			by using use rsImageMibTftpUrl)


			In either case, the objects to be used must be
			set before the final set of rsImageMibActivateTransfer.				Please follow these procedures:
                  
			for case 1:  rsImageMibTftpServerAddress (or
			rsImageMibHostName), rsImageMibImageName and
			rsImageMibDestination must be set.  Do not set
			rsImageMibTftpUrl after these objects are set.

			example: //SNMP add to Primary CM:
			setany -v1 <ip_address> rsImageMibAction.0 2
			setany -v1  <ip_address> rsImageMibDestination.0 -i 2
			setany -v1 <ip_address> rsImageMibImageName.0 -o qa/ssr3000
			setany -v1 <ip_address> rsImageMibTftpServerAddress.0 -a 100.50.6.9
			setany -v1 -d <ip_address> rsImageMibActivateTransfer.0 -i 1

			for case 2: rsImageMibTftpUrl must be set. Do not set
			rsImageMibTftpServerAddress, rsImageMibHostName,
			rsImageMibImageName or rsImageMibDestination after this
			objects is set.

			You can check the required scalar objects to make
			sure they have appropriate values before the final
			set of rsImageMibActivateTransfer.


			CHOOSE OPERATION:
			For choosing an image as the active image for the 
			next reboot, follow this procedure:
			
			The objects to be used must be set before the final 
			set of rsImageMibActivateTransfer:

			rsImageMibAction must be set as in:
			setany -v1 <ip_address> rsImageMibAction.0 4
			
			rsImageMibImageName must be set as in:
			setany -v1 <ip_address> rsImageMibImageName.0 -o rs30

			rsImageMibDestination can be set as an option as in:
			setany -v1  <ip_address> rsImageMibDestination.0 -i 2
			
			Finally, rsImageMibActivateTransfer.0 must be set as in:
			setany -v1 -d  <ip_address> rsImageMibActivateTransfer.0 -i 1

			Please note: rsImageMibTftpUrl is NOT used in a
			choose.  When the user wants to choose an image, and
			the user sets rsImageMibDestination to dictate which
			flash card(s) the image is to be chosen on, the
			user cannot also use rsImageMibTftpUrl.  Setting
			rsImageMibDestination will set rsImageMibTftpUrl to
			its default value of a blank string.
			

			DELETE OPERATION:
			For deleting an image from a flashcard, follow this
			procedure:

			The objects to be used must be set before the final
			set of rsImageMibActivateTransfer:

			rsImageMibAction must be set as in:
			setany -v1 <ip_address> rsImageMibAction.0 3

			rsImageMibImageName must be set as in:
			setany -v1 <ip_address> rsImageMibImageName.0 -o rs30

			rsImageMibDestination can be set as an option as in:
			setany -v1  <ip_address> rsImageMibDestination.0 -i 2

			Finally, rsImageMibActivateTransfer.0 must be set as in:
			setany -v1 -d  <ip_address> rsImageMibActivateTransfer.0 -i 1

			Please note: rsImageMibTftpUrl is NOT used in a
			delete.  When the user wants to delete an image, and
			the user sets rsImageMibDestination to dictate which
			flash card(s) the image is to be deleted from, the
			user cannot also use rsImageMibTftpUrl.  Setting
			rsImageMibDestination will set rsImageMibTftpUrl to
			its default value of a blank string."
