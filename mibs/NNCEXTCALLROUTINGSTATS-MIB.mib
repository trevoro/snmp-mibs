    DESCRIPTION
      "This MIB module contains management information for
       performance monitoring of call routing statistics.

       Seven types of statistics are provided through 30 tables.
 	Type 1: common stats for static and PNNI routing
	Type 2: static routing specific stats
	Type 3: non-border node PNNI routing per routing table stats
	Type 4:     border node PNNI routing per routing table stats
	Type 5: total stats for non-border node PNNI routing table stats
	Type 6: total stats for     border node PNNI routing table stats
	Type 7: raw stats for all stats in types 1-6.

       The statistics that are maintained are described below together with 
       their definition. For each statistic, a call identifies a setup or 
       an add party to a point to multipoint connection, as signaled by an
       entity originating the connection. A call does not include setup or 
       add party events that are generated as a result of receiving a 
       crankback during processing of the original setup or add party. For a 
       call based statistic ( e.g. PNNI Stat 2- Calls Generating an Initial 
       DTL), a call that is cranked back twice is considered as a single call, 
       and not as three calls, as opposed to an event based statistic (e.g. 
       Crankbacks Received as DTL Originator) where such a call is considered 
       as one setup and two crankbacks. Note that these routing statistics are 
       not maintained across a CallP card activity switch.

       i) Static & PNNI Routing Common Statistics: 

       1.  Number of Successfully Routed Calls Originated from Local Subscribers: 
       This statistic measures all the calls which are originated from subscribers
       at this node and are successfully routed to the called party regardless of
       whether a re-route attempt is involved. This statistic does not include 
       those calls which are originated from a local subscriber and terminated to 
       a local subscriber. It is incremented only when a call is accepted or 
       alerted by the called party.

       2. Successfully Routed Calls Transited via This Node:
       This statistic measures all the calls which are successfully routed via 
       this node. The calls are neither originated from nor terminated to a
       subscriber at this node and are successfully routed to the called party.
       This includes cases where a crankback occurred and the call was successfully 
       re-routed by this node. It is incremented only when a call is accepted 
       or alerted by the called party. 

       3.  Number of Successfully Routed Calls Terminated to Local Subscribers
       This statistic measures all the calls which are successfully terminated 
       to a subscriber at this node. This does not include a call which is 
       originated from a subscriber at this node. A terminating call is treated 
       as successful if it is accepted by the called subscriber. It is 
       incremented when the call is accepted or alerted by the local subscriber.

       4. Successfully Routed Local Calls
       This statistic measures all the calls which are originated from 
       subscribers at this node and are successfully terminated to subscribers 
       at this node. A terminating call is treated as successful if it is 
       accepted or alerted by the called subscriber.

       5. Calls Originated from Local Subscribers
       This statistic measures all the calls which are originated from 
       local subscribers or local subscriber equivalents, e.g., calls 
       originated from SPVC connections, regardless of whether the calls 
       are  successfully routed or not. This statistic includes those calls which
       are terminated to local subscribers. If a call is re-routed by 
       this node, the re-route attempts are not counted.

       6. Calls Terminated to Local  Subscribers
       This statistic measures all the calls which are terminated to a 
       local subscriber or to an SPVC endpoint on this node regardless 
       of whether the calls are successfully routed or not. This statistic 
       includes those calls which are originated from local subscribers.

       7. Local Call Attempts
       This statistic measures all the calls which are originated from 
       subscribers at this node and are terminated to subscribers at 
       this node regardless of whether the calls are successfully 
       terminated or not.

       8. Calls Cleared due to No Routing Table Entry
       This statistic measures all the calls which are cleared by this 
       node due to lack of a routing table entry that matches the called 
       party number. For static routing, this node could serve as an 
       originating node, a transiting node or a terminating node. 
       For PNNI routing, this node could serve as a DTL originator, or a 
       DTL terminator. The called party numbers and calling party numbers
       of the last N cleared calls are made available for a user to display 
       on NMTI screens.
     
       9. Crankbacks Generated by This Node
       This statistic measures all the crankbacks which are generated 
       by this node while routing calls either as a transiting node or 
       a terminating node. The crankbacks which are generated due to 
       signaling failures are not included in this statistic. The called 
       party numbers and calling party numbers plus their failure causes 
       and diagnostics of the last N cranked back calls are made available 
       for a user to display on NMTI screens.
     
       10. Failed Calls at Local Subscribers
       This statistic measures all the calls which are terminating to a 
       local subscriber and fails at this node either because, e.g., the 
       required bearer capability can not be allocated or the local 
       subscriber rejects the call. This includes a call which is 
       originated from a subscriber at this node. The called party 
       numbers and calling party numbers plus their failure causes 
       and diagnostics of the last N failed calls are made available 
       for a user to display on NMTI screens.
     
       11. Successfully Re-routed Calls
       This statistic counts all calls which were successfully setup 
       after having been re-routed at least once by this node (as a 
       result of receiving a crankback). This count is also incremented 
       for entry border nodes that successfully reroute calls. The called 
       party numbers and calling party numbers plus their failure causes 
       and diagnostics of the last N failed calls are made available for 
       a user to display on NMTI screens.
    
       12. Calls Failed in Re-routing  
       This statistic counts all calls which failed to be setup after 
       having attempted re-routing at least once by this node (as a 
       result of receiving a crankback).  This count is also incremented  
       for entry border nodes that failed to reroute calls. The called 
       party numbers and calling party numbers plus their failure causes 
       and diagnostics of the last N failed calls are made available for 
       a user to display on NMTI screens. 

      ii) Static Routing Specific Statistics:

      1. Calls Statically Routed by This Node
      This statistic measures all the calls which are statically routed 
      over an NNI by this node regardless of whether the calls are 
      successfully routed or not. If a call is cranked back and re-routed 
      by this node again, the re-route attempts are not counted.

      2. Crankbacks Received by This Node
      This statistic measures all the static routing crankbacks which are 
      received by this node either as an originating node, or as a 
      transiting node. The called party numbers and calling party numbers 
      plus their failure causes and diagnostics of the last N cranked back 
      calls are made available for a user to display on NMTI screens.

      3. Re-route Attempts
      This statistic measures the number of times static routing is used 
      to re-route calls as a result of crankbacks. This node could be 
      serving as a transiting node or an originating node. The called 
      party numbers and calling party numbers plus their failure causes 
      and diagnostics of the last N re-routed calls are made available 
      for a user to display on NMTI screens.

      4. Routing Loops Detected by This Node
      This statistic counts the number of routing loops which are detected 
      by this node. The called party numbers and calling party numbers of 
      the last N routing loops are made available for a user to display on 
      NMTI screens.

      iii) PNNI Per Routing Table Statistics:
      The following statistics are gathered for each PNNI QoS routing 
      table generated as a result of a configured PNNI Routing Table
      Descriptor. The PNNI Per Routing Table Statistics are divided 
      into two subsets: 
      a)  Non Border Node Statistics
      These statistics are relevant for calls for which this node does 
      not serve as a peer group border node. This node can serve as 
      originator, transit, or terminator for such calls.
      b)  Border Node Statistics
      These statistics are relevant for calls for which this node is a border 
      node. The node can serve as an entry border, or an exit border for 
      such calls.
      Note that a given node can increment both types of statistics, 
      depending on the role it plays for a specific call. 
     
      iiia)Non Border PNNI Per Routing Table Statistics:

      1. Failed Calls Due to Initial DTL Not Generated 
      This statistic measures the number of calls for which an initial 
      DTL could not be generated by the originating node.  
      This is the case where a routing table entry is found for the called 
      party in the routing table but a path could not be built due to 
      routing constraints (e.g. insufficient path bandwidth to the called 
      party, path cost exceeding the configured Routing Table Descriptor 
      maximum). Note that this is different from having no routing table
      entry for the called party. This statistic is not incremented in 
      crank back cases. The called party numbers and calling party 
      numbers plus their failure causes and diagnostics of the last N 
      cranked back calls are made available for the user to display on NMTI.

      2. Calls Generating an Initial DTL 
      This statistic measures the number of DTLs which are generated
      initially by this node for calls which are originated from 
      local subscribers, or from an SPVC source, or for calls which are 
      received over an NNI from outside the PNNI domain. 
      This statistic is incremented regardless of whether the calls are 
      successfully routed or not. This count does not include the DTLs 
      which are generated in order to re-route calls as a result of crankbacks.

      3. DTL Originated Calls Successfully Established Without Re-routing 
      This statistic measures the number of calls for which this node 
      is the DTL Originator which were successfully established without 
      being cranked back to this node. 
      Note that this includes the case where a call has been rerouted 
      in some other peer groups by the entry border nodes.

      4. DTL Originated Calls Successfully Re-routed 
      This statistic measures the number of calls for which this node 
      is the DTL Originator which were successfully setup after having 
      been re-routed at least once by this node (as a result of receiving 
      a crankback).  The called party numbers and calling party numbers 
      plus their failure causes and diagnostics of the last N reroute 
      attempts are made available for the user to display on NMTI.

      5. DTL Originated Calls Failed in Re-routing  
      This statistic measures the number of calls which failed to be 
      setup after having attempted re-routing at least once by this 
      node (as a result of receiving a crankback).  The called party 
      numbers and calling party numbers plus their failure causes and 
      diagnostics of the last N failed calls are made available for 
      the user to display on NMTI. 

      6. Successful Calls with Bandwidth Greater than Routing Table 
      Descriptor Minimum Bandwidth 
      This statistic measures the number of successfully established 
      calls for which this node is the DTL originator, and which were 
      routed using this routing table even though the call's requested 
      bandwidth was greater than the Routing Table Descriptor's 
      Minimum Trunk Available Bandwidth. This statistic indicates 
      that no configured Routing Table Descriptor was configured to 
      match the traffic descriptor of the call, and 
      that this routing table was the best one to attempt to route 
      the call. 

      7. Failed Calls with Bandwidth Greater than Routing Table 
      Descriptor Minimum Bandwidth
      This statistic measures the number of failed calls for which this
      node is the DTL originator, and which were routed using this 
      routing table even though the call's requested bandwidth is greater 
      than the Routing Table Descriptor's Minimum Trunk Available Bandwidth. 
      This statistic indicates that no configured Routing Table Descriptor 
      was configured to match the traffic descriptor of the call, and that 
      this routing table was the best one to attempt to route the call. 
      The called party numbers and calling party numbers plus their failure 
      causes and diagnostics of the last N failed calls are made available 
      for the user to display on NMTI. 

      8. Crankbacks Received as DTL Originator 
      This statistic measures the number of crankbacks which are received 
      by this node for calls which are originated from local subscribers 
      or from a local SPVC source or for calls which are from an NNI from 
      outside the PNNI domain. It includes the crankbacks which are received 
      on a re-route attempt. Note that a single call can receive many 
      crankbacks and hence increment this statistic multiple times. The 
      called party numbers and calling party numbers plus their failure 
      causes and diagnostics of the last N cranked back 
      calls are made available for the user to display on NMTI.

      9. DTLs Generated as DTL Originator due to Crankback 
      This statistic measures the number of DTLs which are generated by 
      this node in order to re-route a call for which this is the originating 
      node, as a result of receiving a crankback from a previous attempt to 
      route the call. This count does not include the DTL which is generated
      initially to route a call. This count specifies the number of times 
      the originating node generated DTLs for alternate paths. The called 
      party numbers and calling party numbers plus their failure causes and 
      diagnostics of the last N cranked back 
      calls are made available for the user to display on NMTI.


      iiib) Border Node PNNI Per Routing Table Statistics:
      These statistics are only relevant for border nodes, that is nodes 
      with at least one outside link crossing the peer group boundary. 
      These statistics are incremented for calls for which this node serves 
      as an entry border node or/and an exit border node.

      1. Failed calls due to initial lower level DTLs not generated
      This statistic measures the number of calls from another peer group 
      for which this node is an entry border node and for which a lower 
      level DTL could not be initially generated. This can be due to 
      different reasons, ( e.g., the destination address is not found, 
      a path to the next peer group specified in the DTL is not found, 
      insufficient path bandwidth to the called party number, ..). 
      This count is not incremented in crankback cases. The called party 
      numbers and calling party numbers plus their failure causes and 
      diagnostics of the last N calls are made available for the user to 
      display on NMTI. This statistic is equivalent to non-border node 
      statistic 1.

      2. Calls generating initial lower level DTLs 
      This statistic measures the number of calls from another peer group 
      for which this node is an entry border node,  and for which lower 
      level DTLs are generated and pushed by this node onto the received 
      DTL stack.  This statistic is incremented regardless of whether the 
      call is successful or not. This count does not include the lower 
      level DTLs that are generated as a result of crankbacks. 
      This statistic is equivalent to non-border node statistic 2.

      3. DTL generated calls successfully established, no reroute
      This statistic measures the number of calls for which this node 
      is an entry border node, which were successfully established 
      without being cranked back to this node.  This statistic is 
      equivalent to non-border node statistic 3.

      4. DTL generated calls successfully established, with reroute
      This statistic measures the number of calls for which this node 
      is an entry border node, which were successfully established after 
      being rerouted at least once by this node. The called party numbers 
      and calling party numbers plus their failure causes and diagnostics 
      of the last N calls are made available for the user to display on NMTI.
      This statistic is equivalent to non-border node statistic 4.

      5. DTL generated calls failed in rerouting
      This statistic measures the number of calls for which this node is 
      an entry border node, which failed to be established after having 
      attempted rerouting at least once by this node. In this case, a 
      crankback is generated and forwarded by this node to the previous 
      peer group. The called party numbers and calling party numbers plus 
      their failure causes and diagnostics of the last N calls are made 
      available for the user to display on NMTI. This statistic is 
      equivalent to non-border node statistic 5.

      6. Successful Calls with Bandwidth Greater than Routing Table Descriptor 
      Minimum Bandwidth 
      This statistic measures the number of successfully established 
      calls for which this node is an entry border node, and which were 
      routed using this routing table even though the call's requested 
      bandwidth was greater than the Routing Table Descriptor's Minimum 
      Trunk  Available Bandwidth. This statistic indicates that no Routing 
      Table Descriptor was configured to match the traffic descriptor of the 
      call,   and that this routing table was the best one to attempt to 
      route the call.  This statistic is equivalent to non-border node 
      statistic 6.

      7. Failed Calls with Bandwidth Greater than Routing Table Descriptor 
      Minimum Bandwidth
      This statistic measures the number of failed calls for which this node 
      is an entry border node, and which were routed using this routing table
      even though the call's requested bandwidth is greater than the Routing 
      Table Descriptor's Minimum Trunk Available Bandwidth. This statistic 
      indicates that no Routing Table Descriptor was configured to match 
      the traffic descriptor of the call, and that this routing table was 
      the best one to attempt to route the call. The called party numbers and
      calling party numbers plus their failure causes and diagnostics of the 
      last N failed calls are made available for the user to display on NMTI. 
      This statistic is equivalent to non-border node statistic 7.

      8. Crankback received as an entry border node
      This statistic measures the number of crankbacks received for calls 
      for which this node serves as an entry border node. This count is 
      incremented only for crankbacks for which this entry border node is 
      allowed to perform rerouting. This count includes the crankbacks 
      which are received on a re-route attempt. The called party numbers 
      and calling party numbers plus their failure causes and diagnostics of 
      the last N calls are made available for the user to display on NMTI. 
      This statistic is equivalent to non-border node statistic 8.

      9. Lower level DTLs generated due to received crankback
      This statistic measures the number of lower level DTLs that are 
      generated and pushed by this entry border node in order to re-route 
      a call as a result of receiving a crankback from a previous attempt 
      to route the call. This count does not include the lower level DTLs 
      that are generated initially to route the call. The called party 
      numbers and calling party numbers plus their failure causes and 
      diagnostics of the last N cranked back calls are made available 
      for the user to display on NMTI. This statistic is equivalent to 
      non-border node statistic 9. 

      iv) PNNI Routing Total Statistics:
      These statistics are totals for all QoS routing tables used to route 
      calls.One routing table is generated for each QoS Routing Table 
      Descriptor. These statistics are divided into two   subsets:
      a)  Non Border Node Statistics
      These statistics are relevant for calls for which this node does 
      not serve as a border node. This node can 
      serve as originator, transit, or terminator for such calls.
      b)  Border Node Statistics
      These statistics are relevant for calls for which this node is a 
      border node. The node can serve as an entry 
      border, or an exit border for such calls.
 
     iv a) Non Border Node PNNI Routing Total Statistics
     These statistics include an aggregate for each statistic maintained 
     per QoS  routing table,  in addition to some other PNNI statistics. 
     The statistics 1 to 9 are the total values for all QoS routing tables. 
     The statistics 10 to 12 are not maintained per routing table because 
     they do not involve a DTL Originator node where a routing table 
     lookup is required.

     1. Failed Calls due to initial DTL Not Generated
     This statistic is the total value, for all routing tables, 
     of the per routing table statistic 1 described in section 
     iii a). No diagnostic info is available for this aggregate statistic.

     2. Calls Generating an initial DTL 
     This statistic is the total value, for all routing tables, of the per 
     routing table statistic 2 described in section iii a).

     3. DTL Originated Calls successfully established without Re-routing
     This statistic is the total value, for all routing tables, of the 
     per routing table statistic 3 described in section iii a).

     4. DTL Originated Calls successfully Re-routed
     This statistic is the total value, for all routing tables, of the 
     per routing table statistic 4 described in section iii a). 
     No diagnostic info is available for this aggregate statistic.

     5. DTL Originated Calls Failed in Re-routing
     This statistic is the total value, for all routing tables, of the 
     per routing table statistic 5 described in section iii a). 
     No diagnostic info is available for this aggregate statistic.
  
    6.Successful calls with bandwidth greater than routing table 
    descriptor minimum  bandwidth
    This statistic is the total value, for all routing tables, of the per 
    routing table statistic 6 described in section iii a). 

    7.Failed calls with bandwidth greater than routing table descriptor 
    minimum bandwidth
    This statistic is the total value, for all routing tables, of 
    the per routing table statistic 7 described in section iii a).
    No diagnostic info is available for this aggregate statistic.

    8. Crankbacks Received as DTL Originator
    This statistic is the total value, for all routing tables, of the 
    per routing table statistic 8 described in section iii a).
    No diagnostic info is available for this aggregate statistic.
    Note that this statistic does not include statistic 12.

    9. DTLs Generated as DTL Originator due to Crankbacks
    This statistic is the total value, for all routing tables, of the 
    per routing table statistic 9 described in section iii a). 
    No diagnostic info is available for this aggregate statistic.
 
    10. Calls Received as Transit Node over Inside Links
    This statistic measures the number of calls received over a PNNI 
    signaling link when this node is not the DTL terminator. This node 
    serves as a PNNI transit node for such calls. Incrementing this 
    statistic does not imply that the call was forwarded to the next 
    node. Calls that fail CAC or that encounter other call 
    processing failures are counted by this statistic.

    11. Crankbacks Received as Transit Node over Inside Links
    This statistic measures the number of crankbacks which are received 
    by this node over inside links, when this node serves as a PNNI 
    transit node. This statistic does not include statistic 12, since in 
    this case the 36170 passes on the crankback without making any 
    alternate routing decisions while in the case of statistic 12,  the 
    36170 may choose a parallel trunk group to route the call on. The 
    called party numbers and calling party numbers plus their failure 
    causes and diagnostics of the last N cranked back calls are 
    made available for a user to display on NMTI screens.

    12. Succeeding End Blocked Crankbacks Received over Inside Links
    This statistic measures the number of Succeeding End Blocked PNNI 
    crankbacks received by this node over inside links, when this node 
    serves as a DTL Originator or a PNNI transit node. This count specifies 
    the number of times this node chose a trunk group to use to forward 
    a call and the succeeding node could not admit the call on this trunk group
    (e.g., due to CAC failure, no VCIs available, etc.). In this case, if 
    a parallel trunk group exists to this same succeeding node, the call 
    may be retried by this node to the succeeding node using this parallel 
    trunk group. The called party numbers and calling party numbers plus 
    their failure causes and diagnostics of the last N cranked back calls 
    are made available for a user to display on NMTI screens.

    iv b) Border Node PNNI Routing Total Statistics
    These statistics are only relevant for border nodes, that is nodes 
    with at least one outside link crossing the peer group boundary. 
    These counts are incremented for calls for which this node serves as 
    an entry border node or/and an exit border node. These statistics 
    include an aggregate for each border node statistic 
    maintained per QoS routing table, in addition to some other border 
    node statistics that are not maintained 
    per QoS routing table since no routing table lookup is required. 
    The statistics 1 to 9 are the total values for all QoS routing tables. 
    The statistics 10 to 14 are not maintained per QoS routing table.
 
    1. Failed calls due to initial lower level DTLs not generated
    This statistic is the total value, for all routing tables, of the 
    per routing table border node statistic 1 
    described in section iii b). No diagnostic info is available for this 
    aggregate statistic.

    2. Calls generating initial lower level DTLs 
    This statistic is the total value, for all routing tables, of the 
    per routing table border node statistic 2 described in section iii b).

    3. DTL generated calls successfully established, no reroute
    This statistic is the total value, for all routing tables, of the 
    per routing table border node statistic 3 described in section iii b).

    4. DTL generated calls successfully established, with reroute
    This statistic is the total value, for all routing tables, of the 
    per routing table border node statistic 4 described in section iii b). 
    No diagnostic info is available for this aggregate statistic.

    5. DTL generated calls failed in rerouting
    This statistic is the total value, for all routing tables, of the 
    per routing table border node statistic 5 described in section iii b). 
    No diagnostic info is available for this aggregate statistic.

    6. Successful Calls with Bandwidth Greater than Routing Table 
    Descriptor Minimum Bandwidth 
    This statistic is the total value, for all routing tables, of the 
    per routing table border node statistic 6 described in section iii b). 

    7. Failed Calls with Bandwidth Greater than Routing Table Descriptor 
    Minimum Bandwidth
    This statistic is the total value, for all routing tables, of the 
    per routing table border node statistic 7 described in section iii b). 
    No diagnostic info is available for this aggregate statistic.

    8. Crankback received as an entry border node
    This statistic is the total value, for all routing tables, of the 
    per routing table border node statistic 8 described in section iii b). 
    No diagnostic info is available for this aggregate statistic.

    9. Lower level DTLs generated due to received crankback
    This statistic is the total value, for all routing tables, of the 
    per routing table border node statistic 9 
    described in section iii b). No diagnostic info is available for 
    this aggregate statistic. 
 
    10. Calls received over an outside link
    This statistic measures the total number of calls received at this 
    entry border node from a node in a different peer group over an 
    outside link. This count is incremented regardless of whether the 
    call is successful or not.  

    11. Calls transmitted over an outside link
    This statistic measures the total number of calls transmitted by 
    this exit border node over an outside link 
    to a node in a different peer group. This count is incremented 
    regardless of whether the call is successful or not. 

    12. Crankback received over an outside link
    This statistic measures the number of crankbacks that are received
    at this exit border node from a node in a different peer group over 
    an outside link. This statistic does not include statistic 13 below. 
    The called party numbers and calling party numbers plus their failure 
    causes and diagnostics of the last N cranked 
    back calls are made available for the user to display on NMTI.

    13. Succeeding End Blocked crankback received over an outside link
    This statistic measures the number of succeeding end blocked crankbacks 
    received at this exit border node from a node in a different peer 
    group over an outside link. In this case, the exit border node tries to 
    reroute the call to the same neighbor peer group using a parallel trunk 
    group if one exists. The called party numbers and calling party numbers 
    plus their failure causes and diagnostics of the last N cranked back 
    calls are made available for the user to display on NMTI.

    14. Crankback forwarded to previous PG, crankback level too high
    This statistic measures the crankbacks that are passed on to the 
    previous node in a different peer group, when this entry border node 
    receives crankbacks for calls for which it did not generate any DTLs 
    of equal or higher level than the crankback level. In this case, 
    this node is not allowed to re-route the call, and the crankback 
    is forwarded unchanged to the previous peer group. The called party 
    numbers and calling party numbers plus their failure causes and 
    diagnostics of the last N cranked back calls are made available for 
    the user to display on NMTI.
   



	The call routing stats are intervalized with 15-minutes and 24-hour
   intervals. In addition to the intervals, the raw cpunter of the stats are 
   also provided. The 15-minute intervals include the current interval and 
   the last 4 intervals.The 24-hour intervals include the current interval and 
   the last 1 interval.

	All tables use one or all of the three indices, namely, 
   nncExtCallControlGroupNumber,  nncExtNBPerTbl15MinIntervalNumber,
   nncExtTableDescriptor.
   (1) nncExtCallControlGroupNumber contains information about Shelf, Slot No. etc. It uniquely identifies 
       the slot number associated with call routing stats.
   (2) nncExtNBPerTbl15MinIntervalNumber or nncExtNBPerTbl24HourIntervalNumber identifies
	at which interval the stats should be retrieved.
   (3) nncExtTableDescriptor determines a routing table number whose stats are to be displayed.

-- A formal review meeting was held on Monday, April 10th 2000, to review
-- the CallRoutingStats MIB. 
-- Attendees are marked with * in the TO and CC list above.

-- Action Items:
-- 1). George Yu and Carl Rajsic to find out whether the entPhysicalIndex
-- has active/inactive info and resolve the issue of whether to use the
-- CallControl group as the index
-- status: closed

-- 2). Carl Rajsic to find out for 1+1 hot redundancy, whether the inactive
-- CallP card has the same stats as the active one
-- status: closed


-- 3). Yi Fang to put a description up front in the MIB for the following 6
--   category of tables:
--     Static and PNNI Common Statistic
--     Static Routing Specific Statistic
--     Non-Border Node PNNI Per Routing Table Statistics
--     Border Node PNNI Per Routing Table Statistics
--     Non-Border Node PNNI Total Statistics
--     Border Node PNNI Total Statistics
-- status: closed


-- 4). Adrian Tsang to update the FS (31FS0100) for the index once action
-- items 1 and 2 have been resolved
-- status: closed



--
-- An EDR was closed on 2000.04.28 to review the updated CallRoutingStats.mib.

-- Outcome
--
-- It was the consensus of the review team that this file is acceptable
