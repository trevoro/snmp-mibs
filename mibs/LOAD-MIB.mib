-- Version: 1.3.4			13, September 2000
--
-- Version 1.3.4 - 13/Sep/2000 - ItaiZ
-- 1. syncStandbyAgent(11) replaces 
--    copyConfigToStandbyAgent(11),copySoftwareToStandbyAgent(12)
-- Version 1.3.3 - 13/Sep/2000 - ItaiZ
-- 1. Support for P550/P880  stand-by Agent
--  Added copyConfigToStandbyAgent(11),copySoftwareToStandbyAgent(12) to 
--  genOpIndex.
-- 2. genAppFileId is now bounded by range (1..65535).

--
-- Overview:
--
-- The Load MIB defines upload, download and copy of application software
-- and configuration information.
--
-- The genOperations group
--
--   Each row in the genOpTable represents an operation that this system can
--   perform. A walk of this table should provide a list of available 
--   operations that can be performed by the system.  The genOpTable contains
--   all configuration information nessary to perform upload, download, and
--   copy operations within the system.  Source, Destination, operational 
--   trigger, opertional status and error logging information are contained 
--   on a per row basis (each row again representing an operation that 
--   this table can perform).
--
-- The genApplication Group
--
--   Table of Application (FILE) entries.  Each row uniquely defines an
--   application in the system.  Applications can be defined as any entity 
--   that can be read or written from or to the system.  This includes 
--   software images, boot code, configuration files, prom code, etc. 
--   Each row contains information used to catalog the application (FILE)
--   entries present in the system. A walk of the genAppFileTable should
--   provide a directory-like listing of all application software, 
--   bootcode, configuration files and misc. accessable embedded software
--   in the system.  Each entry contains information about the application 
--   such as type, size, version number and date stamp.
