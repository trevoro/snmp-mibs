 -- This file describes the Shiva Enterprise MIB, as supported by
 -- K-STAR Release 9.1. It includes object identifiers and object
 -- definitions for the Shiva Enterprise MIB only, and should be
 -- useful for compilation by a management tool in order to extend the
 -- tool to support the Shiva MIB.

 -- The companion file "mib.txt" describes all the variables supported
 -- by this release of K-STAR, and should be useful as a summary of
 -- FastPath SNMP functionality.
