   DESCRIPTION
       "An entry in this table is created by an LSR
        for every interface capable of supporting
        GMPLS.  Each entry in this table will exist
        only if corresponding entries in

        If the associated entry in
        mplsInterfaceConfTabel or ifTable is
        deleted, the corresponding entry in this
        table must also be deleted shortly
        thereafter.
        The indexing is the same as that for
        mplsInterfaceConfTabel.  Thus, the entry
        with index 0 represents the per-platform
        label space and contains parameters that

   DESCRIPTION

        that GMPLS signaling cannot be performed on
