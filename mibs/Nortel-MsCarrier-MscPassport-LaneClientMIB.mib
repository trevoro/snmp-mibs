-- LanEmulationClient/n
-- This component represents a LAN Emulation Client (LEC) as 
-- specified in the ATM Forum LAN Emulation over ATM 
-- Specification (LANE). The LEC provides a MAC level emulated 
-- Ethernet service to higher layer protocols using ATM VCCs.
-- 
-- The 'laneClient' feature must be provisioned on all ILS and ATM 
-- cards.

      level component has a CID of 0.
      
      Every operator session also has a CID, which is the CID 
      provisioned for the operator's user ID. An operator will see only the 
      stream data for components having a matching CID. Also, the 
      operator will be allowed to issue commands for only those 
      components which have a matching CID.
      
      An operator CID of 0 is used to identify the Network Manager 
      (referred to as 'NetMan' in DPN). This CID matches the CID of 
      any component. Values 1 to 8191 inclusive (equivalent to 'basic
