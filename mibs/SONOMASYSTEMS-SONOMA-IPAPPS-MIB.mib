            "This object is used to initiate file transfer between this
             unit and the file server identified by
             tftpFileServerIpAddress.
             A download indicates that the file transfer is from the
             file server (down) to the device. An upload indicates a
             file transfer from the device (up) to the server.
             This object can be used to initiate either image or
             parameter file downloads and a parameter file upload.
             There is no image file upload feature.
             An image file can be downloaded via either a BootP request
             (where the image filename and the BootP server's IP Address
             is unknown) or via a TFTP request where the user has
             configured the tftpFileName object with the path and
             name of the file.
             BootP cannot be used to download or upload a parameter
             file.
             An attempt to set this object to one of the following
             values: startTFTPImageDownload, startTFTPParameterDownload
             or startTFTPParameterUpload, will fail if either the
             tftpFileName or tftpFileServerIpAddress object has
             not bee configured.
             The tftpFileName and tftpFileServerIpAddress
             objects are ignored for BootP requests.
             A value of noAction is always returned to a GetRequest.
             Seting this object with a value of noAction has no effect.
             The startPrimaryImageTFTPDownload is used to initiate the
             download of the primary boot image. This image is only downloaded
             when there is a new revision of the basic boot mechanism or
             changes to the flash or CMOS sub-systems."
